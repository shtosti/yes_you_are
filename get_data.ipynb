My friend had to go to remedial anti-bullying classes for the rest of the year and we both had to attend special events meant to help bullied kids and their bullies make friends. I never said that she hadn’t spit on me out of maliciousness, and I don’t know why; after that first day it just felt like I couldn’t say anything because it had become such a big deal.

Everyone thought he'd done it and was just trying to blame me so as not to embarass himself. Which made him angrier. It's been years and he hasn't completely forgiven me.

They had to put their cards on the table, it was impossible for them to play any longer due to the laughter.  Somehow a young boy was blamed for it and he was crying with everyone giving him side eye (sorry to that young boy wherever you are).  Everyone was out of the water with arms folded angry they couldnt use the pol anymore.  By now, we were laughing so hard, our sides were hurting.

I then decided to expose my lie to him ; the friend I was going to bring was actually a girl and I was very confident they would hook up as they *really* have a lot in common.

I didn't know what to do but I instantly felt shame and fear,  but at the same time felt I shouldn't tell anyone,  so I just closed the book with my shame inside.

After that I was so enraged I plotted against her all year. One day she brought her gameboy to school and was bragging to everyone how expensive it was and how they were so cool… I stole it right from their desk and hid it somewhere in the classroom.

They shrieked and giggled and made a scene the entire time about the guys they were with not looking at them. A friend and I took a look at the commotion, stood next to our tents, and stripped naked right out in the open. Then we calmly got dressed. The young men from the local religious institution watched in fascination. When the young women figured out what was going on they were incandescent with anger.\n",
      "I was recently the AH when my son was having a tantrum because he wanted to go play outside but we were under wildfire smoke advisory and had to stay inside. Instead of comforting him and trying to find a nice indoor activity, I started laughing and taking his picture because he had a Mickey Mouse hoodie on with the hood up and he looked ridiculous stomping around and screaming with mouse ears. I think in the end it upset him more that mommy was laughing at him. I still laugh at those pictures though, and given the opportunity, I wouldn't do anything differently...\n",

      "I ran an Airbnb and the only toilet broke during the night. I offered to take time off work the next day to stay with the plumber but my guest wanted her privacy. Turns out it took the plumber 2 hours to fix and what the guest really wanted was a deep discount on her holiday. I did not offer her a discount. I knew that she was unhappy and would never stay again so I decided to keep the money.\n",

      "When I was in my low-to-mid 20's (Im 54 now) I worked at a kiosk type gas station across the street from a 7-11 with 2 payphones outside and 1 inside.  I wrote down the numbers to the payphones and would randomly call people I could see standing near them, but who had no idea who was calling and say dumb shit like, \"Its Code 444, your cover is blown. Execute exit strategy immediately!\" and hang up.\n",

      "I’m the asshole because I once changed my guess about the number of jelly beans that I thought were in the jar in second grade to win a Lunchable. I had never eaten a Lunchable and it was this cool kid thing to eat. I won and ate it in shame and it was my core memory to not lie about things to get ahead.\n",

      "My first year of college, one of my roommates gave me permission to use her computer a couple times. I interpreted that to mean I could always use her computer if she wasn't using it.

A mutual friend had to explain to me that I was being obnoxious by constantly going into her room to use the computer without her permission when she was out.\n",

      "I work in a machine shop, so about a bit more than a year ago when I saw that a coworker had broken a few small parts, I took them out to the scrap container, but was stopped by my boss on the way. So when he asked who's responsible for that, I told him. I didn't think any of it, as things like that have always been no big deal. \n",
      "I realized my mistake the moment I saw my boss's face. He immediately took the parts from my hands and started rambling about how costs for everything have exploded since the Russian invasion of Ukraine and whatnot and that my coworker will be written up for this. I have always made a point to never snitch on my colleagues, but in that very moment my brain gave up on me. Still feel bad about it, although he forgave me the very moment that I apologized.\n",
      "I was six or seven.  Extended family out at a local pizza restaurant.  I had already burned through the few quarters dad gave me to play Galaga and saw my younger cousin pop one in for a game.  I crowded him out of the way and said \"Let me show you how to play this!\"\n",

      "And he protested but watched as I made it to level 2 and died.  He then protested and said \"I'm telling!\"  I looked at him and said \"Hey!

      "Back in college, I knew two brothers Jon and Kenny (names changed, obviously). Jon was a very nice guy I met through our LGBT society. Kenny was a wee bit of an ignorant lad, who was very nice, but also homophobic (I mean, it was early-2000s in Ireland... most people low-key were, but when others are pointing it out, it means it's a bit more than background level, but not on a Fred Phelps). Kenny didn't know his brother was gay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kenny loved trying to wind me up, especially about techie stuff (I was studying CompSci at the time); it was really weak-sauce stuff like \"Oh, Windows is *so* much better than Linux\". Most of the time I did *not* bite. But one day we were in the computer room, and I was working on something, and Kenny just *kept* trying to get under my skin while I was working. Eventually, I just had to leave in frustration; I wasn't pissed off by what he was saying, but the fact that he was trying to wind me up, even when I was saying I was busy.\n",
      "\n",
      "3 minutes later, I decided to storm back into that room and loudly told him, \"Kenny, it's a pity you're straight. Because if you weren't, there's half a chance you'd be intelligent, charming and articulate JUST LIKE YOUR BROTHER!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I stormed out like the drama-queen AH that I try not to be most of the time. Apparently Kenny was very quiet, and looking very confused, for the rest of his time in the computer room that day.\n",

One day I remembered that we had about $1k of gift cards from our wedding 2.5 years before.  I packed them up with my passport and other important documents we kept in that location.  I immediately spent one on a new TV for myself.  The rest I kept and spent gradually over the next months before the divorce was finalized. \n",

Remind him about [appliances].”  She popped back in 30 seconds later and said, “He had forgotten about that. Anyway, thanks for your time.” \n",

Every day. Good I didn't eat, didn't ask for and didn't want. After asking nicely, asking firmly, flat out starting and then demanding her to stop I finally lost it on her and made her cry.

About 2 days later I woke up and went down to the basement to find the trap had caught a mouse. I was so excited I ran to tell my dad, and he told me I had to walk to the end of the street and dump it out. Sadly I walked, in the freezing cold (it was late November), to the end of street. I felt so bad thinking the mouse would freeze to death out here. But then I noticed the last house on the street had there garage door wide open.

Front of house staff all had multiple ‘drink spots’ where we’d store/hid our drinks during shifts, between different spots in the kitchen, host stand, bar, etc. Well I’d figure out the top most common drinks different coworkers would have, and their favorite places to store them. Then I would regularly switch their drink spots. Ex. If they usually had their drinks in one of three spaces (and they usually used only one spot per shift) I’d move it around the 3 different spots during a single shift. Making them question where they actually were keeping it, but would never realize I was moving them. \n",

We also all had to use the restaurant cups with straws, which were Styrofoam, so you couldn’t see what was in the cup. So on one shift they’d be drinking milk and I’d switch it for lemon water while they were busy.

My best friend who also nannied for them said the kid texted her on the daily, so I told the kid I had to pay for every single text message I sent or received. Told the my friend what I’d told the kid and she ended up telling the kid the same thing.

Before the room filled with this *horrendous* smell, I noticed one of my dogs slinking towards the exit with a guilty look on her face.  Everyone blamed my nephew, and my sister went to check his diaper (he was in cloth, so she didn't waste a diaper on an unnecessary change).  When she came back in, she was talking about how the diaper was empty and she didn't understand where the smell came from.  That's when I spoke up and said \"Ellie, my dog, farted.\"  My sister died laughing \"The dog farted, and my baby got blamed!!!\"\n",

Sometimes the assignments work out!\n",

      "Yeah, this seems like a set up for a disaster for the bullied kid. Whenever they stand up for themselves or try to get away, the bully just pulls the old “no, you have to be my friend, you can’t do that”. It sounds like a total trap for the bullied kid. Maybe not in all situations, but my bullies already did a form of this (my parents had the totally brilliant thought that me standing up for myself was causing my bullies to hate me, so if I just never said no and never got upset, things would be fine… not!!)\n",

It's not that I don't have interests to go elsewhere on reddit, it's more that I find the concept of moderating so fascinating. Reddit's style of moderation is unique among social media platforms, and from everything I've experienced it's what makes reddit a place that I enjoy being. So I spend a lot of time talking to other mods (we do weekly talks on r/modguide), supporting other mods when I can, and participating in other mod programs and communities. If you've ever been somewhere on the internet and thought to yourself \"wow, this place doesn't feel like 4chan\", that's only the case because of moderation. I joined the mod team here because I wanted to make sure this stayed a place I enjoyed visiting. If I'm spending time on reddit, I'm often trying to do something to help others do the same for their communities.\n",

I actually read the rules on subs before I comment/post and am a much more frequent reporter on other subs than I was pre-mod days. I can’t help but see rule, content policy, and mcoc violations now.

We also regularly share stuff in modmail, our private mod sub, discord, pretty much anywhere we can type we will.\n",
      "Oh that’s really interesting! The way news organizations approach social media is also fascinating, especially on Reddit because of the way moderation works.

If the boys sense any weakness or division they will exploit that and they will play you off of one another. Once they know that their bad behavior will be punished every time consistently by both you and your husband they will eventually improve. They need to know the rules.

      "**this** - my dad had more children when I was already an adult. When my siblings stay with me - they know that boundaries will be enforced, they are pretty much a delight with me and they stay decent blocks of time. Occasionally they try to push the boundaries a bit but nothing drastic and they are approaching teenagers now. With my dad- it’s a whole different story- he does anything for a quiet life, so they know if they push and push he will just give in. He’s an AH and won’t stand up for what they need- eg regularly school night bedtimes will be early hours of the morning. I see it’s his weakness and laziness that does the most damage. If he would just put the minimal work into enforcing stuff in the first place, it would be a whole lot less painful later. Also he almost gives them permission to be naughty, when he calls them bad. It seems to me, if that’s what the expectations, are, that’s what they will behave like. Tbh I’ve seen it with other parents- them making a joke about ohhh *darling child’s name*- what are we going to do with you?! Or ‘rewarding’ the child for the wrong behaviour- eg wingeing and getting the toy in the end.

It seems they do what they want and everyone else just looks at OP to fix the mess they create.  These boys are beyond the age of acting this way.  They’re acting like 3 year olds.  They need more time outs, toys taken, and major consequences.  It looks like OP tries but mom and DH disagree and here we are.  Feral children and the only one who behaves is the toddler GIRL child.

It's sad that OP is finding herself in this situation; ideally she wouldn't have let the family go on the vacation at all, but since her husband is causing her to question her own authority, I can see why she had to make a seemingly drastic decision in the what of the moment. \n",

One of my kids has ADHD, and he still respects he rules because all our large extended family is all board with them.

Allowing your kids to run amok because they're free spirited is not good parenting.\n",

I’ve taken a misbehaving kid out to the car to let the rest of the family eat in peace.  Truth is, I only had to do it once per kid.  Lol they remember. Grabbing the two misbehaving kids and going home is what they needed.  NTA.  Lay down the law, set consequences for bad behavior, and follow through every time.

The only reason I think OP is NTA is because she is overwhelmed, completely lacking support from her husband and mother, and needed to do something dramatic to be taken seriously.

The kids almost always respond really well to proper boundaries and discipline. Often the parents are afraid to tell their kids no or enforce rules, or even have rules! And then they wonder why they have three kids who are constantly screaming and hitting and drawing on walls and running off into traffic. You can see so clearly how actually it makes the kids extremely miserable too to not have any boundaries enforced. They’re actually much happier when their parents take charge, even if it means they can’t do whatever they want all the time.\n",
      "No, that’s preposterous! Everybody knows that, when you see someone under the age of 18 behaving annoyingly, the proper course of action is to assault them and, through societal norms, convince the child that hitting them was morally acceptable and that they were actually the only one out of line. Of course, if you attack a badly behaved adult, it’s jail for you.\n",

As arguably the least well behaved of his children though I’m pretty sure that phrase is part of a subconscious systems check that occurs before most of my decisions. I will say, my favorite of all his little sayings was always when he/someone else would fart and he would just give you this look and say “Can’t hold what you don’t have in your hands.” 🤣\n",

An hour and a half later, just a half hour from our destination, sis starts back up with her bullshit. Mom pulled over at a gas station, used the pay phone to call my grandmother to explain why we wouldn't be there, got back in the car *and drove back home*. She did not have a good summer because, on top of being grounded, mom made her spend it working off every cent spent on gas to drive back and forth across 6 states. The next year, sis decided that maybe a long road trip wasn't the best time for showing her ass.\n",

      "I am 1 of 3 children, all born during a span of 3 years (i.e. very close in ages, love/hate relationships growing up)... every vacation was a road trip to a beach/campground with lots of tourist trap stuff - waterparks, mini-golf, festivals, etc... \n",
      "\n",
      "The few times we were separated between parents to do things apart resulted in taunts, fights, and all-around resentment towards each other... over really stupid minor differences in what we got/did... because that's what siblings do...\n",
      "\n",
      "And, for the record, we never would've left a vacation early... if we were acting up or disobeying our parents, we got a smack, put in separate areas/rooms and then were left out of whatever activity was planned for that day (one parent stayed behind, while the good kid got to go with the other).\n",
      "\n",
      "This only happened a couple of times, on different vacations, a couple of years apart... then never again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Funny side note: we were all chatting this past mother's day about how we should go back to one of those places for a family trip to \"re-live\" our childhood... lol\n",
      "8 or 9 years ago, a petite woman driver was rear ended at a very, very low speed but it set off her airbags and she was killed.  This was on a regular city street.  She was stopped at a red light.\n",
      "Is the ability to deactivate an airbag not intended to allow the use of car seats?\n",
      "\n",
      "I always understood it that airbags are very unpleasant to experience, but are still better than the consequences - the person ending up face planting into the solid construction of the dashboard. So you should always leave them active unless there is some additional structure that will interfere with their operation and potentially cause danger (such as a car seat).\n",
      "I’m pretty sure it’s a required that the system shut off the airbag under a certain weight\n",
      "Thats my impression too.  The kids are acting up because they can.  Set limits.  Follow through.\n",
      "MIL would have been cursed out along with the kids, lol. Everybody can get some.\n",
      "This isn't the MIL, it's her own mother.\n",
      "OPs line of \"laying down actual consequence\" leads me to believe OP gets undermined a lot with punishments\n",
      "The grandma is OP's mother, not MIL. So she's sabotaging her own daughter.\n",
      "Worst punishment in our home growing up. Our aunt watched us while my parents were working. Every afternoon at 12:55 we were put down for a nap. I didn't nap, I read, but as long as I was quiet, Aunt didn't care.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if you screwed up royally, the high punishment was missing your nap to spend an hour on the couch watching soap operas with Aunt. The Young And The Restless as I remember. Nikki and some guy that looked like Clark Gable. Ugh!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "To us it was torture. Lol\n",
      "Thank the Gods there were no cell phone cameras when I was a teen or I wouldn't have made it to adulthood.\n",
      "I have had the arm implant for a decade now (obviously not the same one) and it has been better that I ever would have imagined birth control would be from school sex education classes. I got it first when I was 17, before I became sexually active, and I am forever glad I did. Since I, unfortunately, can’t have my baby parts ripped out and have always known I don’t want kids, this is the best option out there. For me, at least. I have never had to worry about a lil’ sprout unexpectedly growing, it only needs to be changed every few years, I don’t feel it or notice it, it is painless having it inserted and switched out (even when there was cell wall buildup around it so they had to do some digging), and it’s pretty funny to show people the “cheeto” I have in my arm. \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically three years of antibaby arm stick at a time without being terrified my shit-brain and shit-memory will fail me and I’d have to live with the “killing a FULL HUMAN PERSON” guilt when the little glob gets scrambled out of me.\n",
      ".....we were supposed to check the placement once a month?! lmao the gyno I saw never told me that. although tbh I did like randomly poking it but not every month status. More like when BC came up, it turned into show and tell.\n",
      "It's a contraceptive IUD that you have inserted, which lasts for 5 years.\n",
      "This is a 4 day long vacation at the beach that was a 3h drive from their house. It was a long weekend not a lifetime-memory making holiday. If the kids are ruining it for mom and she can’t enjoy any of it, it is completely reasonable to say “nope, cutting this one short guys were going home.” The little one will never remember and they can try again in 2 weeks if they want to do some minor logistics.\n",
      "Those poor kids would've ended up costing mom money, ruin the place they're staying at. and they learned to not misbehave on vacation\n",
      "Yeah, this is kind of the problem honestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "OP can try to parent properly until she is blue in the face, won't work if her husband AND mother override and undermine her because kids can see the 2 against 1 against Mum. \n",
      "\n",
      "They know they can act up because Dad and Grandma will just decide Mum is overreacting/being too harsh, so why would they listen to her?\n",
      "\n",
      "OP doesn't just have a son problem with her boys acting up, she also has a husband problem and a mother problem, and needs to start setting hard boundaries and getting counseling with her husband to get on the same page, that he is encouraging the sons to be brats! \n",
      "\n",
      "He is not helping by giving into them, he is reinforcing them acting up so they get their way more often and making it harder for them both!\n",
      "That's why Grandma was there. They weren't outnumbered.\n",
      "If these kids aren't pulled back and disciplined, when they get older they may start bullying and terrorizing the parents.  Will the father and MIL still say they're just kids, let them have their fun?\n",
      "That's what I was thinking, this isn't your average sibling conflict behaviour. An 8 and 9 year old generally don't spend their entire days fighting and sabotaging each other, so there might be something else going on.\n",
      "I agree for the most part but therapy is not the cure-all a lot of people on reddit think it is. Counseling only helps if people agree they need help and want to get help. If dad thinks he's done nothing wrong and insists that his boys are \"just being kids\" or whatever, OP is just going to be wasting her money. Dad won't listen to anything the counselor says and will continue to undermine mom. Idk what the solution is, tbh. I feel bad for OP who is in a horrible situation. Unless she can convince her husband that he is being a bad dad and that they both need to be on the same page, then this will only continue. The boys will learn that mom is uptight and no fun and they should just ignore her because dad will side with them, dad will continue to enable them and insist that things will 'get better', but they never actually will.\n",
      "It's crazy. My parents would have turned around before we even got there. \n",
      "\n",
      "And I feel like my husband would have done the same. It does sound like Dad and Grandma didn't want to help discipline...and thats crappy.\n",
      "Also when reading the post it seems like the boys are being told what not to do, but not what they CAN do. It’s easy to say as an outsider reading one paragraph I know! But I feel like kids struggle to come up with their own ideas of what ‘good’ behaviour is. Also if you tell someone not to do something, that plays on their mind until they do it- I even know adults like this. Just a brief thought from some random stranger who hadn’t been in the thick of it for 8/9 years!\n",
      "I think if they were left dealing with the kids alone they would change their tune because OP wouldn't be there to do the heavy lifting of parenting. But even if not atleast she would get a break I guess.\n",
      "Why is reading linked to punishment?  Please don’t do that!!\n",
      "Um please don’t use reading as a punishment. Dear lord.\n",
      "It’s impractical to suggest that you can have kids in the same family completely avoid each other. Kids need to be able to behave well enough to sit down at the dinner table together or go out to run an errand without all hell breaking loose. It’s also just an important skill in general to be able to interact with people you don’t love. Everyone has had a coworker that have to get along with or a group project with someone that doesn’t pull their weight. These boys are also only one year apart so they’re going to have many years of going to the same school, participating in activities together, being invited to the same birthday parties etc.\n",
      "Look, it’s both. You have to distract and separate and you also have to lay down the law. \n",
      "\n",
      "Even adults find it hard to keep their cool when they’re around people who antagonize them. Same with kids. Separating them gives them a breather. Gives them a chance to behave well so you can give some positive reinforcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course also you often have to lay down the law. When that happens, you need to give an immediate consequence. Take them out of the restaurant when they’re misbehaving. Take away a privilege (no pool for an hour if you throw chalk in it). \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, you have to do what you can to physically make it hard to misbehave. Eg why were they wearing shoes indoors in the first place? Have everyone take them off in the front hall and then you don’t have to worry about couches.\n",
      ">9 & 8 are old enough to know how to behave, these boys are just disobeying.\n",
      "\n",
      "A child of *any* age only knows what they've been taught - either through explicit instruction or consistent modeling by the adults in their life.  That includes regulating emotions when dealing with others, especially siblings (ask your professional friends, they can explain more).  Your \"Because I Said So\" model isn't guidance and it's not effective.  It literally prolongs and amplifies the dysfunction, and just leaves the parent frustrated because they think their kids suck, but the reality is, they're not actually parenting anyone.\n",
      "Sorry, this is a ridiculous take.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I am angry with my partner, I can take a walk and clear my head instead of being rude and lashing out. An 8 year old can't because they (a) don't know they need it (b) don't have the skill to go out on their own/plan anything and their parents have already planned out the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "So an 8 and 9 year old have to stay attached at the hip just because they're siblings?\n",
      "\n",
      "I bet if you ask the kids what's going on, they would say \"he hit me\", \"he took my game\", etc all the way going back to before they even got in the car. Sometimes you need to break the cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Separate them, take them somewhere slightly fun and talk to each of them separately reminding them that they don't need to take every dare their brother suggests and can ignore their brother if he's winding them up instead of escalating, and tell them both they can look forward to a big activity together later in the holiday, like a waterpark or something. Then put them together again and see if they can get along better.\n",
      "I don't think your parents were wrong for trying even though it didn't work\n",
      "I couldn't believe I read this whole thing and she didn't set a consequence until they left...\n",
      "\n",
      "won't put on sunblock at the beach?  they have to go back up to the house...\n",
      "\n",
      "get too far out into the water? They can't go in the water for the rest of the day...\n",
      "\n",
      "Put their shoes on the furniture?  Why aren't they taking their shoes off at the door?\n",
      "\n",
      "Without knowing more of their dynamic at home I can't say if OP is clueless, or she's trying her best and undermined by her spouse and MIL.\n",
      "\n",
      "But \"consequences\" can't just pop out of nowhere.  To have good discipline you need to say \"If you do X, Y will happen\" and then you follow through every time.  If you don't give that warning, and just spring consequences out of nowhere, sometimes, but not always, they won't actually learn to listen.\n",
      "I love mine too! I’m also not interested in kids but sterilization isn’t a great option for me or my partner due to medical issues. Nexplanon is actually a little more effective than a vasectomy (failure rate of 0.15% versus 0.05%) so we prefer to stick with this anyway. Insertion was a breeze and very non-intrusive and I haven’t really had any side effects. Of course it’s not for everyone, but I recommend people consider it if they like HBC.\n",
      "Yes! Nothing complicated, you just need to touch it once a month just to ensure it’s still there and about where you expect it. I got mine in 2021 shortly after it was approved by Health Canada, so this might be a newer recommendation but I know Nexplanon also states this in their paperwork.\n",
      "I went to the gyno recently and they said it had changed to 7 years! Check with your Dr!\n",
      "Ah.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think the word \"coil\" threw me.\n",
      "Grandma wasn’t there to help, she was there to spoil the grandkids.\n",
      "I counted one parent, 3 kids, and 2 child enablers undermining the 1 parent.\n",
      "Agreed. It’s gotten to the point where a marriage counselor FIRST, then behavioral therapy, is needed. Something’s got to shock the dad enough to realize he could lose his family.\n",
      "I’m sorry but this comment is ridiculous. Kids of that age know what they can and can’t do (within reason). It does not need to be spelled out for them like this.\n",
      "That wouldn’t have been a punishment to me as a kid! They all leave and I get to stay alone and read? Whoo-hoo!\n",
      "\n",
      "Just a reminder I guess- kids aren’t all the same and anyone that tells you they know how to handle them all is full of shit.\n",
      "No, that's not true. Children do learn also on their own, not only what they are taught, unless you completely isolate them. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also at any point I didn't say I'd support autoritarian parenting. I'm actually very much the opposite. I don't even do punishments of any kind, nor do I really have to even discipline my kids. I talk to them and with them, listen to them. But in OP's case it sounds like these boys don't think they have to listen to their mother because the father and grandma don't see anything wrong with boys. They are putting themselves even in danger (going farther in water) because they don't listen. When things are in that point, you have to do something little radical (like end the vacation) to make them undersrand you're being serious. Like a reset.  Then start building thins again from the start, sit down and talk.\n",
      "No, they weren't wrong for trying... and they realized it didn't work and found something that did.\n",
      "\n",
      "All I'm saying is if the boys are already going at each other, my experience suggests that separating them to do FUN things won't help... \n",
      "\n",
      "It may have worked for OP's boys, but it WOULD be a reward for bad behavior... which I don't agree with... imho...\n",
      "Honestly. These would be logical “real” consequences for these behaviors. Not implementing consequences until you blow up and take a nuclear option doesn’t teach these kids how to behave.\n",
      "That’s exactly my point too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why on earth would you let the kids behave like little morons for so long? I mean they begged for consequences earlier and that would’ve been much easier and smoother than ruining the holiday for your daughter.\n",
      "\n",
      "The grown ups and the boys are pretty much ok, each of you had the opportunity to do something, to modify behavior or start a discussion but how about the daughter?\n",
      "Just because her brothers have trouble with rules she was robbed off a vacation. That’s somehow unfair to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Easiest way would’ve been a clear statement: \n",
      "Guys, I expect you to be on your best behavior. If you can’t, you’ll face consequences, because that’s my vacation too. \n",
      "And then stick to it.\n",
      "No shoes in the house. Wanna keep them on? Fine, not allowed inside then.\n",
      "No sunscreen? Fine - no outside time then.\n",
      "Wanna drown yourself? Fine by me. No water for you anymore.\n",
      "Restaurant desaster? Okidoki, got that. Restaurant food for your sister and the rest of the family and you’ll get sandwiches instead of warm food. Hell I’d take turns with my husband eating take out from restaurants just to spoil their behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Be creative - they’re young now. Do you really wanna have that behavior during their teen years?\n",
      ">\"If you do X, Y will happen\" and then you follow through every time.  If you don't give that warning, and just spring consequences out of nowhere, sometimes, but not always, they won't actually learn to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the way. If you as a parent just do 'enforcement' when you're tired or aggravated, not to be embarrassed,  or once in a while, it's just useless. I get the impression that OP hasn't ever put down consequences and has only used warnings: If you do that, we're going home---but then stay at the park; No, boys, you won't have ice cream if you do that, but they still get ice cream, because sister already is getting it. Also not making them do responsible home things like picking up after themselves. Those boys might need some team building type activities to get along.\n",
      ">get too far out into the water? They can't go in the water for the rest of the day...\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah because the *real* consequence would be the kids going out too far into the water and getting swept away by a tide and drowning. It's definitely best to shut that behavior down ASAP.\n",
      "Yes! I recommend it to literally everyone, especially after so many horror stories and my friend having an (etopic? I can’t remember what it is called, but the egg developing in the Fallopian Tubes) pregnancy and almost dying. I know it’s not for everyone, but it is a game changer and I am always down to let them feel mine so they can see it’s not that bad haha.\n",
      "I have about 1 year left until I need mine replaced, but will ask my gynecologist when the time comes. Thanks for the heads up.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Edited to add**: I've just checked the NHS website and it states that it depends on what brand coil you have inserted. Each one has a different time frame. But will ask my doctor at my next appointment if it's updated in the UK. Will follow whatever advice my gynecologist gives.\n",
      "They said 7 when my partner got hers — she got it for hormonal regulation and PMDD — but barely after 5 years, she started feeling emotionally dysregulated again. The hormones don’t just shut off at 7 years, they start to diminish quite a bit before that. Still an effective contraceptive during that time? Maybe. Hard to say, since everyone’s needs are different.\n",
      "Right? They’re 8&9 not 2&3\n",
      "Not if they haven't been taught. It sounds like they are allowed to run the show, with everyone throwing up their hands in a \"what do we do\" way.\n",
      "I agree that that they may know to some extent, but if they have only ever experienced punishment for bad behaviour, but not positive reinforcement for good behaviour, they may have the attitude of who cares if we are bad, doesn't make a difference anyway. At least we get some form of attention if we are bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not saying this is the case as I don't know OP or their situation, but with a lot of kids I've worked with who were labeled \"brats\", often it went deeper than just the surface level behaviour. Behaviour is a form of communication for kids and adults.\n",
      "We think this, because it makes perfect sense, but telling them what they *can* do is a technique that has been repeatedly shown to improve behaviour. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ \n",
      "\n",
      "It's probably because it's positive & they can focus on it and succeed, whereas when we talk about what *not* to do... if all they do to try to obey is think about what they *shouldn't* be doing, ironically it becomes much more tempting.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's like if I challenge you to win $100 from me. I'm a psychic, and the challenge is very simple. All you have to do is *not* think of a snake wearing a cowboy hat, for 10 seconds. Simple but not easy, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "But then if I add that instead you can think of an elephant wearing a tiny cowboy hat on the end of his trunk, the challenge becomes much easier!\n",
      "Not necessarily. In fact, the discussion creates a needed boundary between the parent and child that sets up for a review when things go wrong. \n",
      "\n",
      "”Here are your choices: pool,  Xbox, switch with your siblings is available. Reading solo and riding your bike solo is also available. Snacks will be available in \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. I expect that you will not have trouble with each other or making a choice. If you do, I expect you to choose solo activities. I will check on you in \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_. If you guys can’t self manage, I will step in and the consequences are 1, 2, 3.\n",
      "I think what they mean is instead of just saying dont or stop.Try redirecting.Like hey come lets do this or why dont you go n do that then we can do this.If your 8/9yos are not at least that obedient then just let them run wild then😶of course my experience is only of 4yo but thats what i do when he is bratty\n",
      "They know what they can and can’t do *if it is taught to them and reinforced*. Boundaries are not an innate understanding that kids have, they need to learn them and have them reinforced over time.\n",
      "If they're taught. Honestly, I *was* a kid who acted out because I *didn't* actually know what counted as acceptable ways to spend my time. I literally did not know that, and my parents just assumed I did - or else, they gave me two different sets of rules, much like OP and their husband are. So I constantly got in trouble. I was fucking bored, and my siblings were annoying (in my child POV), and I had no idea what to do with my time that wouldn't get me in trouble. Of course I acted out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adults seem to forget - kids literally do not know anything about *anything* until you teach them. Age appropriate knowledge is entirely dependent on them having *learned* that somewhere. The knowledge does not come from nowhere. They do not pop into the world with knowledge. They are basically tiny aliens - they know *nothing* when they are first born, they have *nothing* to compare to, and you literally have to build the foundations of their entire belief/knowledge system.\n",
      "Wish I hadn't had to learn this the hard way. Parenting is as much about unlearning bad habits we modeled from growing up as it is about learning positive habits we choose as adults.\n",
      "I also had Nexaplanon and loved it! Unfortunately after an awesome year and a half I started having terrible side effects. Went from no period to two heavy periods a month, mood swings, weight gain and zero sex drive. Ended up switching it out to the mirena and so far so good.\n",
      "Heh. I just got the Paraguard. Hormone free lasts ten years. I’m pretty excited.\n",
      "When I was trying to get mine replaced, my gyno’s office said that further testing and data have shown 7 years is the minimum the hormone levels are adequate to effectively prevent pregnancy for most people. It may be closer to 8 years or more for some people. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had mine for hormonal stuff (PCOS and endometriosis) and it stopped being strong enough to help me in a therapeutic manner right at about the 5 year mark too. Other than the insertion hurting, I really liked my Mirena. If I still had a uterus, I would probably have still have Mirena.\n",
      "Yes, I have one primarily for managing endometriosis symptoms. I was due to get it replaced after 5 years but had no symptoms and the doctor said I could leave it another year. Had a second check up six months later and by then I had symptoms and my endometriosis was getting worse, so I definitely felt that it was losing efficacy by then and had it replaced.\n",
      "Exactly this. Praising kids as soon as they do something 'right', even if it's just little things like taking their plate to the kitchen after a meal without being asked etc, gives attention that reinforces the good behaviour. If you just wait til kids do something wrong then correct them, it can lead to a cycle of them only getting attention for bad behaviour.\n",
      "This. Also if OP is giving them one set of rules, and Dad is giving them a completely different one - how the actual fuck are they supposed to know where the boundaries are? How *do* they know what they can and can't do? They probably literally don't - because Mum says \"you can't do this\", but Dad's saying it's *fine*. Who do they listen to? Who's right?\n",
      "🙌 Congratulations!!! 🙌\n",
      "Did the removal hurt too? I am about due, but dreading it, since the insertion hurt a lot.\n",

      "My husband and I regularly go out with four other couples except this time there was a new couple that came along. Each couple pays for their own meal.  Everything is expensive. Everything is à la carte. So we ordered the tomahawk steak with a vegetable and with a lobster mac and cheese and one with mashed potatoes because I’m pregnant and can’t eat seafood. My husband also ordered a really expensive bottle of wine but offers it to the rest of the table after he poureds himself a glass letting them know that it’s on him. The couple that is new to the group is looking at us strangely and comments about us ordering the most expensive steak on the menu. She just looked at me and said “ Way to flaunt your money around!”  So I looked at her and I said “excuse me”. She said  “well you didn’t have to order the most expensive items on the menu” I said “ well the last time I checked my husband and I were paying for ourselves so we order what we like. If you have a problem with it, that problem resides with you. I have no problem with the fact you ordered the cheapest thing on the menu, because I’m not paying for you. So please don’t try to count my money and I won’t count yours”. My husband makes a joke to try to make light of the situation and everyone laughs. At the end of dinner I go to the ladies room, when I come out of the stall she’s there waiting for me and she says “ I really don’t appreciate how pretentious you and you’re husband are with ordering the most expensive food on the menu!”  I told her we all paid for our own food  and ours were not the most expensive things on the menu as they were dishes that were more expensive and I didn’t appreciate her being in my business and considering that she’s new to our group trying to imply that I’m somehow being pretentious when she doesn’t know me and then I told her to tell me she’s jealous without telling me she’s jealous. Then I told her if she doesn’t have enough money she should keep her broke ass home!” I know it was mean but I found her audacity disgusting and I just wanted to put her in her place and I felt like she was trying to bully me for whatever her reasons are. I don’t really care.My longest friend in the group text me saying that I offended the new couple and should apologize . I asked apologize for what?  Should I apologize for her assuming I’m pretentious or should I apologize to her for not being able to or not wanting to order what we ordered. I’m really confused about what I should be apologizing for? So I asked her did she tell you what she said to me also and then she was literally waiting outside of my bathroom stall for me to come out. She said yeah she told me So I asked how do you feel that I should apologize? So my friend said that the other woman’s feelings were really hurt and she was crying. I tell my friend my feelings were hurt when she attacked me? I basically told her I would not be apologizing and when you mess with the bull you get the horns!.  So AITA?\n",

Truth be told we are both good at what we do but we are very different and of course I am her superior and I will always be. I have bigger responsibilities and all that comes with the work and position I hold. For some reason my wording hurt her soo much that she started an harassment campaign. It was vicious to say the least and she gathered “admirers” around her because apparently putting women down is a good activity for some. Well, I let her do her thing for a while and then…let’s say I made her cry.

OP is taking responsibility for the insults, but I’m not sure the insults alone make her an AH enough to warrant an E S H (none of this would’ve come up if the new woman kept her judgements to herself, that must’ve been an embarrassing position for OP to be put in with the several other couples there!

It makes sense to me that if OP is being attacked for having the luxury of a little wealth that they would be inclined to snap back with a similar insult. Like if someone really skinny calls me fat, I tell them they can have some of it because they look like they need it. I don't actually believe that they look bad, but it attacks them in the same way they attacked me.\n",

If you’re so insecure about your own finances that you have to *repeatedly* make negative comments someone else spending their money, that is highly inappropriate. OP may not have been super kind or empathetic in their response, but this person confronting them as they walk out of the *bathroom* about something that harms nobody and isn’t their business is weirdo behavior and should be called out.\n",

      "What does it say about the new woman, that she is getting this aggravated over the order? Maybe she is jealous, yes.

Maybe there are other reasons altogether.\n",

If anyone is acting like a Real Housewife, it’s the woman talking shit about how much OP spent at dinner. Like who actually cares? One could argue that calling someone unhinged is *also* mean. I think the perfect reaction in the bathroom would have been to say, “You are out of line and I’m not engaging in this conversation with you any longer.” That would have been the best way to shut it down. But most people forced into confrontation that takes them by surprise do not respond perfectly. If OP’s account of the incident is true, than yes, she could have responded better both times. But the person who acted completely inappropriately and made the situation awkward in the first place was not OP, it was the new person. While two wrongs don’t make a right, we shouldn’t forget this entire drama was created and started by the new person to the group. It was wildly out of line. IMO there’s *more* culpability in creating the situation than being forced to react to it.\n",

Both the husbands make good money - one makes noticeably more than I do - but both my wife and I have professional careers, we don't have kids and we're way more responsible with money. As a result we have a lot more investments, etc. and we don't have to drive cars full of kid debris and we take nice trips once or twice a year. It definitely grates on both sisters and by extension their husbands. So we get some petty behavior from them on an ongoing basis.\n",

Yes, let's have fun in the water, but in order to have fun we need a designated, sober person who's keeping an eye on the children. It's not fucking rocket science, it's just basic planning - if you can plan for who brings the beer you can plan for who's watching out for the people most likely to drown.\n",
      "The hair in the jet thing has never occurred to me and that is absolutely terrifying. People often treat hot tubs like a different class of water than a pool—a special magical class where nothing can go wrong, and drinking is safe.\n",

      "Absolutely - it doesn’t seem like anyone was taking responsibility for the safety of these kids, which is horrifying. I don’t blame OP for assuming they could swim - I’d assume the same thing if kids that age were allowed to run around close to a pool, wearing bathers, with their parents watching on in complete unconcern.\n",
      "Except these are 7 and 8 year olds and I don't know if you've kept up with kid tv but a lot of the things kids watch are very violent. Or prank content or attention grabbing trends.

      "Great point\n",
      "Even assuming they land the best possible way, that's a good way to break an ankle. You don't jump into the shallow end of pools unless you are small enough that it is deep for you. And the guest that did get pushed in sounds like they got pushed in not only at the shallow end, but at the fucking stairs!\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you know what instincts people have when they are push down stairs? To desperately try to fall _backwards_ so they go feet first on their butt, which is a great option to do if you're out on actual stairs (well, better than head first, at least), but if you're in a pool it is a good way to crack your spine on the edge of the pool when your feet slide out from under you.\n",

      "\n",
      "Being really drunk while your kids are running around a swimming pool is incredibly stupid and irresponsible. Not to mention how many ways it could go wrong with kids running around a pool randomly shoving people in.

      "\n",
      "Some parents have less than no common sense.\n",
      "Dangerous too, she got pushed by the steps (and from the sound of it kept her feet when she went into the water) but that means she could have really *fallen* and hit the steps in the shallow water.  Or lost her balance backward and hit the side of the pool.\n",
      "\n",
      "That shit's dangerous, hard surfaces all around and water making things slippery is bad enough if something goes badly, without kids deliberately *trying* to cause accidents for fun.\n",
      "Yeah, I almost said I was shocked that these asshole parents didn’t wrangle their kids after someone left upset. But I’m not. They clearly suck.\n",
      "I mean… it’s the parents that should be controlling the kids, not the grandparents, but I guess an argument could be made that grandparents as hosts should have said something to their kids about drinking less so they could control their children or just general safety rules around the pool. As a mom I would be livid if this happened, but it would all be directed at my child who at 7-10 should be old enough to know better for a bunch of different safety reasons.\n",

      "No way, feral would describe me and my generation. If you're truly feral, you learn not to cry about the consequences you inevitably face. It helps you learn to make better choices. Those poor angels are being robbed! OP endeavored to stop that, for the betterment of future generations.\n",
      "If anyone did this stupid shit at my pool - even my adult children I’d kick them out immediately. I was at a party years ago when I was about 19,’saw a woman get shoved in the pool and her head hit the stone coping and cracked wide open. It’s very lucky she did t die or break her neck. I’ve had pools for decades now, raised kids with them and had a million party’s - this shit is never tolerated. Party hearty, get loaded, don’t get physical with anybody against their will by the fucking pool.\n",

      "If they’re anything like my parents, the mom brings it upon herself, planning the whole thing and enabling her precious grandangels despite dad’s protests, then plays the victim when things go horribly wrong. Camping in the whirlpool is one giant “I told you so.”\n",
      "I’ve seen older couples and can guess the “co hosting” was mom insisting on a party with rowdy kids (including the adult kids) and dad saying “fine, we can invite them, but keep me out of it”.

      "No he didn’t. Their parents were there.\n",
      "I’m sorry, but no. As a parent of two young children, it’s my job to enforce discipline. At my parents or in-laws house, they can set the standard for acceptable behavior, it’s my job to make sure my kids follow it. At least one of us between my wife and I is also going to be sober at these get together, doubly so if there is a pool.\n",
      "If the Dad  was sitting alone in the wirlpool drinking during the party it was not his idea .. I’m sure his wife convinced him to do it.\n",
      "Seeing as it was the Mom who pressured OPs wife to come, there was probably a side conversation of \"okay, we can have the barbecue, but I'm not dealing with the kids this time while their parents are drinking...because that always happens\" or something along those lines.\n",
      "As a dad, probably in his general age range, I figure it was the grandmother's idea for the pool party and he objected but allowed it to happen. I've told my wife she can through a party anytime she wants to but I'm not watching other people's kids while they get smashed. He took the right approach and let her choices lead to the natural consequences.\n",
      "10 to 1 this whole thing was Mom's idea, Dad would have been in the same spot with the same cooler if no one else was there to disturb his peace and quiet.\n",
      "I kind of get the feeling that the dad was an unwilling  host.\n",
      "Dad was smart. He raised his kids & is now done. 😂\n",
      "Who said they were cohosts? More like this was mom’s deal, probably told her bad idea and he wants no part of it and did exactly that…LOL\n",
      "I hope someone told her what happened after she left. Might cheer her up to know the little assholes were thwarted.\n",
      "Yeah if I was that neighbor I’d never go over there again. It could seriously hurt someone of that age if she’d fallen even if it was into water\n",
      "Also, if the neighbor got hurt or had property damaged couldn't they also sue the property owner. I feel like this could have ended a lot worse than having just the parent's phone damaged.\n",
      "Also apparently she was right next to the pool stairs....so she absolutely would have struck the stairs on the way down if she had fallen\n",
      "As long as removed relatively quick\n",
      "Plus the rating system as I understand it is time and depth rating. So you can go deeper for less time or shallower for more time\n",
      "I know what you mean. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a lot more careful in natural bodies than I once was, but I don't think there's a force on earth that could scare me off swimming permanently.\n",
      "I'm quite flabbergasted at the kind of parenting these kids have. Doesn't matter if the kids knew how to swim or not. There are any number of things that can go wrong here. The person being pushed can slip, hit their head against the edge of the pool/stairs/something else, the kids can loose their footing, or hit something. We're talking possibility of major injuries here. \n",
      "\n",
      "If we had tried pulling off something like that, we would have expected major repercussions. Not limited to being scolded. And for far less. \n",
      "\n",
      "I kind of feel sorry for OP's mom having to parent the children around instead of their real parents. OP's dad probably saw it coming and removed himself from any action by anchoring himself to the whirlpool. \n",
      "\n",
      "OP it's not just your phone which you saved. You probably saved your own life. In the end, that's what counts. NTA.\n",
      "Kids should be able to swim latest by age 6. My kids were both 4 when they could swim a few metres for self rescue and could swim 50 meters and dive to 2 m before their 6th birthday. Completely unacceptable to not teach them for this long, c especially if they are around a pool.\n",
      "My brother's know if any if my kids showed their tails, I would be first one to set them straight.  The only person who gets to shove one of my brother's into a pool is me. ;-) Thankfully I am now much too mature to shove them into a pool.\n",
      "This! Does no one care about the guest who was pushed in?\n",
      "> Being really drunk while your kids are running around a swimming pool is incredibly stupid and irresponsible\n",
      "\n",
      "*Especially* when some of them can’t swim!\n",
      "This is what I feared too. I heard too many stories about innocent fun pushing friends into the pool resulting in severe head injuries. Those parents should not have been drinking and letting their children run wild for their own safety and for others. Shame on them.\n",
      "Absolutely agree. We have a pool and often have kids and grandies over. Our golden rule is NO ONE is allowed to run around the pool, and NO ONE is allowed to push anyone in....EVER, or they are banned.\n",
      "I've seen an incident where a couple of kids pushed another at the pool (they're all teenagers) and the kid didn't know how to swim. Luckily it happens in a hotel pool and a lifeguard got in quick. \n",
      "\n",
      "I still can't believe that neither me nor my husband  noticed the kid almost drowning a few metres off my side. I guess the loud noises from the group and them crowding the poolside makes it easy for us to miss out. Imagine this happening around a private pool, with no lifeguard, and everyone getting too shitfaced to notice a struggling kid. It would have ended so bad. \n",
      "\n",
      "(Also OP, NTA!)\n",
      "It would be really interesting if that neighbour needed medical treatments for injuries caused by the children pushing her into the pool- would the parents be liable for her medical bills?\n",
      "Thats what I was thinking! This kids should start learning about pool safety! Don’t push anyone by surprise into a pool ever! And only jump in the deep end!!! Every adult with a pool and/or kids should know this! Hell everyone should know this.\n",
      "Yeah it is very dangerous. People end up with broken necks and backs from being pushed into pools.\n",
      "This just happened to me today and I hit my knee and shoulder, and twisted my wrist!\n",
      "Not only that but those same things could have happened to one of the kids, or multiple of them!! Running and slips before getting to the person? Like good grief this was a mess!!\n",
      "Yeah imo the drunk parents are TA but the grandparents are right up there too : throwing messy parties with too much alcohol, staying in the whirlpool even when your son in law falls on his face (drunken stumble? Heat stroke? Fatal heart attack in his rage? Don't care, keep slurping from my private cooler), having a pool without enforcing any pool etiquette nor swimming lessons apparently...\n",
      "I think both have to parent. If i did something like that, my grandparents and parents would be mad at me\n",
      "Also, isn't it odd that the grandparents have a pool, but at 7 yo the kids still don't know how to swim?  \n",
      "From the way OP describes their bawling, I got the impression they can't even doggy paddle to the steps where they attacked their first victim in order to get out of the water...?\n",
      "100% this. Do we have the same parents???? My mom enables one of my siblings and their children to the detriment of literally everything else.\n",
      "This!!! This was my parents all the time. My dad talking sense while my mom just wanted to make a moment so bad she could never see the impending disaster that was so blatantly clear to everyone else. My dad passed in October, now my mom is just a runaway train. My sisters and I finally realized just how much he actually did rein her in.. My dad didn’t have a whirlpool, but he had his chair. And he took great joy in sitting there and tripping the kids as they ran screaming through the house. Never took his eyes of the tv. Like a damn ninja that size 14 EEE foot would shoot out so fast at the last second they never even figured out it was him. I used to watch him awe\n",
      "I see the misfortune coming, the calamity on the winds. I'd really love to help you hun but I'm just in such a comfy spot In  the whirlpool to watch all of this go to hell in a hand basket.\n",

      "This is exactly what I was thinking, mostly because my mom is that grandma lol.\n",
      "Martyr mom I think. I see it a lot. Christ this isn’t 1950. And let people fail and quit bailing them out of every situation. Sounds like the whole beer drinkin family is a mess. I’ll pass thanks. Lol\n",
      "They do sound like gran-dangels to me. 3 little dangelberries that fell in the pool\n",
      "Dad put in his years of dealing with that shit, now he gets to sit back and watch.\n",

      "And you didn't have any help from grandparents either? Not judging or anything, we're in the same situation because we live on another continent but it seems to be the societal standard that everyone assumes grandma/grandpa will do a ton of unpaid work. Like the number of times I've heard \"can't grandma help?\" when he's sick and can't go to daycare is too damn high...but then again growing up my parents did get lots of help from my grandparents so I thought it was normal in that generation.\n",

      "Welll lol my sons phone was in the lake for two days before a couple found it and returned it and it worked just fine tho how it survived idk they make phones very durable\n",
      "My cousins phone fell off a pier into the ocean, they figured it was toast, it washed up on shore, someone found it and was able to call her brother, got it back and it was fine.  My husband also found a phone while snorkeling; no idea how long it had been sitting there but was able to fish it out and it worked fine.\n",
      "Kinda true. IP ratings are done under lab conditions with fresh phones. It's just a standardized test to say your phone can probably survive being submerged under X meters for X time. Even the. It's more of an approximation at best since a real phone suffers wear and tear with use over time, also not unheard of for phones to fail under conditions easier(or perform better) than their IP rating. Also IP ratings don't mention WaterPROOF, it's water resistant, so drop a phone in chlorinated water, or ocean and we'll yeah... Not good.\n",
      "You're never too mature to shove a sibling in the pool 😂\n",
      "She could have seriously been hurt! Then what?\n",
      "And could have injured herself by falling onto the steps?\n",
      "I remember reading a few years ago about a bride who was pushed into a pool during (I think) her bachelorette party by her bridesmaids and ended up paralyzed for life.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It's so dangerous to push someone into a pool and I am appalled at anyone who thinks it's funny.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I think all kids should learn how to swim, but especially kids who have access to a pool.  And even if the kids can swim, they should still be properly supervised since drowning isn't the only risk involved when it comes to swimming pools.\n",
      "Drowning is *very* easy to miss unless you know what to look for. People tend to expect flailing and yelling, but actual drowning is fast and quiet.\n",
      "Family pool rules:\n",

      "No drinks\n",
      "\n",
      "No phones\n",
      "\n",
      "No cigarettes\n",
      "\n",
      "Any one having these items visible or if you have reason to believe they have them in their pockets is not permitted to be pushed in the pool. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fully dressed but emptied pockets as a precaution?  Fair game.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rules are explained to guests ahead of time and the kids learn them young.  All kids are required to know how to swim to be in pool area. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also courtesy of being safe and making sure pool is clear before pushing in is required.\n",
      "\n",
      "Works for our family.\n",
      "I think we have a good snapshot of Dad's parenting strategy tbh. He may be \"chill\" with OP, but that's double-edged. There's a reason the daughters turned out to be the parents they are.\n",
      "Yes, exactly. I guess he didn’t care if someone sued them for injury or death on his property?\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone’s like, ha ha, dad’s smart not getting involved, just getting his drunk on in the whirlpool. Not really smart at all.\n",
      "That's so weird to me you should be able to have infinite amounts of alcohol at a party it's up to the adults to police themselves and if their parents then one parent at minimum if not one parent for each set of kids or whatever should be staying sober...\n",
      "So admittedly I’m not the best judge of normal adult parent child relationships, my parents have been completely hands off with me since I was 16 (not a positive thing and I lived alone for 2 years finishing high school), so I wouldn’t expect my parents to do or say anything, but I also regulate my own behavior because I’m an adult and I don’t think adults with children of their own should need to be told how to act by their parents.\n",
      "My grandparents had a pool, and I barely learned how to swim. Anytime we were in the water, my cousins would yank at my feet, and I wound up terrified of my head going under. I'd just stay in the shallow end. \n",
      "\n",
      "The weird thing to me is that they let kids who can't swim run around by the pool without floaties or life jackets. We wouldn't have been allowed to run near the pool at all, let alone try to push people into the water.\n",
      "Yea, that is odd!\n",
      "Agree. Like if I found out my parents bought a house with a pool the first thing I would do is enroll my kids in swimming class. Or at least teach them myself. I blame the parents, really. Both for lack of control and  education.\n",
      "When my SIL bought a home with a pool, the first thing she did was organise swimming lessons for her kids. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s been over five years and they still have weekly lessons. The pool is fenced and the gate is locked - only she and BIL have the key. \n",
      "\n",
      "The kids know that if they go near that pool without an adult, they will be in for a world of *serious* punishment. I know kids like to push boundaries, but this is one rule they won’t break.\n",
      "I'm glad I'm not the only one who was concerned that the kids don't know how to swim . I mean heck it's a good idea for parents to get their kids learning how to swim even if they don't have grandparents with a pool\n",
      "Alas, no, because my sister and BIL are actually great parents, but my mom frequently undermines my sister’s parenting. There was a time my parents watched my nieces a lot, and especially in the older one, ingrained some spoiled behaviors my sister still struggles against. I’m not with them often because I live far away, but anytime I am I ALWAYS defer to my sister just to give her any support possible. It’s firmly “go ask your mom/dad.”\n",
      "My family is overall very close and we all get along well in general. However, I think it's a Grandma thing. My mom will do whatever it takes to \"make everyone happy\" when in reality, nobody ends up happy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like I said, not a real issue in my family, but I think it's a pretty universal feeling.\n",
      "My mum does the same thing till things don't go her way and then it's everyone's fault but hers. I, too avoid family get-togethers like the plague.\n",
      "He also was responsible for turning that police officer into Robocop!\n",
      "I would think that the chlorine and other chemicals in the pool would be a major factor in damage to the  phones.\n",
      "If it was off, it would've been fine mostly\n",
      "Lol my wife dropped her phone in the ocean when we were getting in a boat. When we tried to get it replaced, there was some extra payment necessary to use insurance because we didn’t have the old one. \n",
      "\n",
      "We spent the better part of the day on the docks with progressively long fishing nets, diving to the bottom, etc. but that phone was Lost.\n",

      "i pushed my brother during swimming lessons when we were kids and he turned around midair to see wtf happened and smashed his lips and teeth on the deck. \n",
      "i was banned from swimming lessons and also never pushed someone in again. NTA op those kids suck and your sisters suck.\n",
      "I was thinking OP's dad just didn't like the BILs either, just like OP doesn't like them, and therefor just didn't care when BIL fell over, but this ^ could actually be it.\n",
      "That struck a chord with me, too. My grandma had a pool when I was young, and the most stressed rules were no running, no pushing people in (they could hit their head or something), no jumping in the shallow end, and no going in the deep end without floated until you learned to swim. An aunt made sure we could all swim by 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s insane having a pool without enforcing the most basic and common sense rules, at least when young kids are present.\n",
      "Yeah pool etiquette matters a lot. Sorry you were bullied and no one stopped it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Here OP's parents both suck imo, and are TA. OP is NTA!\n",
      "My older brother dunked me a lot, he'd hold me under too. At almost 40 I still have a fear of drowning and I loathe the beach. I know how to swim but avoid it at all costs. Thanks Brandon\n",

      "While their parents were drunk\n",
      "It's what my aunt did with her grandkids. The 6 kids are under 10, so no swimming without an adult in the water. They start with a warm-up where everyone swims or paddles with floaties, and then there is one lane for playing and jumping and one lane for swimming. No running EVER.\n",
      "Good. They'll see someone respects their parents.\n",

      "If the ion content is low it could be ok. Like snow. But yeah basically distilled at that point. I’ve had electronics go in water and were able to be saved. Some not so much. Depends if the electronics were on long enough to create a short.\n",
