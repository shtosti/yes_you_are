Repent Your Assholery as we say Goodbye to Awards on Reddit,750,154rwsu,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154rwsu/repent_your_assholery_as_we_say_goodbye_to_awards/,1541,"So Reddit did a thing. No, [not the API thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Reddit_API_controversy), another thing. They're officially ""[Evolving awarding on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/14ytp8b/evolving_awarding_on_reddit/)."" AKA: killing coins and awards on September 12th. What does that mean for you? Well, we’re lucky enough to have vibrant community awards, many of which are used by you to award your favorite posts and comments. Each time you’ve bequeathed a [Poop Knife, a Diamond in the Poo, a Golden Throne](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/awardarchive), or any of our other glorious custom awards to another user, as well as indulging the display of a beautiful asshole-flavored icon, the mod team has been tithed some coins to bestow via special mod awards. With awards now disappearing, *including retroactively*, that means we have **several hundred** of these special awards to give away, and not much time left to do it.  

We were thinking about fun ways to make a difference, and when it came down to it, we realized that a good way to memorialize the loss of our awards and subreddit history, is to remember that [just like Reddit’s admins](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/14dd0ae/askhistorians_will_remain_in_limited_operation/), *we're all the Asshole sometimes*. So, here is what we propose: 

**Tell us in the comments about a time** ***you*** **were the asshole. Keep it short, simple, and** [**non-violent**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_what_types_of_posts_are_covered_by_rule_5.3F)**.** 

While supplies last, we’ll crown your glorious repentance with a special Golden Asshole award created by the amazing u/bvbblegvmbitch just for this sendoff award thread.

Unfortunately, you won't be able to see it on your comment after awards go away on September 12th. But hey, you will get a month of premium!

PS: Did you know that Reddit is [bringing back r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/154qutf/rplace_is_back_again/)? Wouldn’t it be fun to see our shiny new Golden Asshole award front and center, for the whole world to admire and enjoy? Food for thought.

AITA for ordering an expensive dish on a group couple outing,3203,157988w,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157988w/aita_for_ordering_an_expensive_dish_on_a_group/,1003,"My husband and I regularly go out with four other couples except this time there was a new couple that came along. Each couple pays for their own meal.  Everything is expensive. Everything is à la carte. So we ordered the tomahawk steak with a vegetable and with a lobster mac and cheese and one with mashed potatoes because I’m pregnant and can’t eat seafood. My husband also ordered a really expensive bottle of wine but offers it to the rest of the table after he poureds himself a glass letting them know that it’s on him. 

The couple that is new to the group is looking at us strangely and comments about us ordering the most expensive steak on the menu. She just looked at me and said “ Way to flaunt your money around!”  So I looked at her and I said “excuse me”. She said  “well you didn’t have to order the most expensive items on the menu” I said “ well the last time I checked my husband and I were paying for ourselves so we order what we like. If you have a problem with it, that problem resides with you. I have no problem with the fact you ordered the cheapest thing on the menu, because I’m not paying for you. So please don’t try to count my money and I won’t count yours”. My husband makes a joke to try to make light of the situation and everyone laughs. At the end of dinner I go to the ladies room, when I come out of the stall she’s there waiting for me and she says “ I really don’t appreciate how pretentious you and you’re husband are with ordering the most expensive food on the menu!”  I told her we all paid for our own food  and ours were not the most expensive things on the menu as they were dishes that were more expensive and I didn’t appreciate her being in my business and considering that she’s new to our group trying to imply that I’m somehow being pretentious when she doesn’t know me and then I told her to tell me she’s jealous without telling me she’s jealous. Then I told her if she doesn’t have enough money she should keep her broke ass home!” I know it was mean but I found her audacity disgusting and I just wanted to put her in her place and I felt like she was trying to bully me for whatever her reasons are. I don’t really care.

My longest friend in the group text me saying that I offended the new couple and should apologize . I asked apologize for what?  Should I apologize for her assuming I’m pretentious or should I apologize to her for not being able to or not wanting to order what we ordered. I’m really confused about what I should be apologizing for? So I asked her did she tell you what she said to me also and then she was literally waiting outside of my bathroom stall for me to come out. She said yeah she told me So I asked how do you feel that I should apologize? So my friend said that the other woman’s feelings were really hurt and she was crying. I tell my friend my feelings were hurt when she attacked me? I basically told her I would not be apologizing and when you mess with the bull you get the horns!.  So AITA?",1690101027.0
AITA for cancelling vacation less than 24 hours in due to my kid's behavior?,8945,1574lbc,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1574lbc/aita_for_cancelling_vacation_less_than_24_hours/,2966,"My husband and I have 3 kids, 9M, 8M, and 3F. The boys have been driving us crazy. They fight like cats and dogs. We’ve had countless talks with them about respecting each other, to no avail. I understand sibling rivalry but it’s gotten to the point it’s disruptive to us all, every day.  
  
I already told my husband last week I wasn’t sure if the vacation was a good idea. My husband shut me down pretty much immediately and things went ahead as planned.  
  
First of all, the 3.5 hour car ride was (predictably) hell. Boys fighting and riling each other up the whole time. Husband and I kept trying to reassure each other that things would be better once we got there and they would be too excited to cause trouble.  
  
We were wrong. They had so many reminders of what not to do once we got to the rental house…so they do everything wrong from the get go.   
  
Shoes on the white furniture? Check. Running in the house? Check. I turned my back for 2 seconds and the 8 y/o threw a box of chalk in the pool to keep his brother from getting it. We went out to lunch and they were out of control in the restaurant. 9M ran away from us in a strange place because he didn’t get his way. 

  
We finally go to the beach and they are frankly being brats. Refusing sunscreen. Fighting over toys. Pushing their luck repeatedly going farther and farther out in the water than we told them to. Cursing.   
  
By the time we got back to the house, it was around dinner time and I was fed up. They were totally ruining it for everybody. Nothing had worked and I told my husband we needed to go home, for the reasons mentioned above, mainly that they needed to see a REAL consequence.  
  
My husband still insisted it would get better. I put my foot down and told him that I didn’t even want to be there at that point so either I was leaving, or we all were. He got super pissed and told me it was ridiculous and unfair to our daughter. I actually agree with him but saw no other choice at this point. Of course when I tell the kids they immediately burst into tears and are begging to stay, promising they will behave.  
  
My mother, who came with us, was also near tears. She thinks her precious grandbabies do no wrong.  She argued with me too, begging me to “just let it go” but I refused to budge. So, we left, less than 24 hours into a 4 day vacation.  
  
Half the ride home was spent with them sobbing and my husband pretty much gave me the silent treatment the whole way. My mother decided to stay behind a little longer but then started randomly texting me about 30 minutes in, asking if I was serious (she knew I was) and told me the whole reason she came was to spend time with the kids, so I had now “ruined it for everybody” and “they’re only little once”.   
  
Here we are the following evening and pretty much no one likes me right now except my 3-year-old. Are they right? AITA?

AITA for calling my grandmother fat after she humiliated me on my birthday?,1314,157b384,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157b384/aita_for_calling_my_grandmother_fat_after_she/,536,"A week ago, my parents threw me a surprise dinner at a very fancy restaurant with all of my family members to celebrate my 17th birthday. When it came to ordering food, I decided to order quite a bit since i hadn’t eaten all day. When everyone finished ordering, I overheard my grandmother making comments on my order and how if i keep eating like that i’d get fatter than i already was. Deciding to not create drama, I discreetly brought it up with my parents and they confronted my grandmother. Very loudly, she exclaimed “I’m telling the truth! Look at the size of her! I don’t know how you let her order that much!” 
She had made comments about my weight multiple times in the past and i’ve tried to shrug it off or ignore her since i’m the average weight for my age. The restaurant went silent. I dropped my stuff and got up and exclaimed that she shouldn’t be talking because she was fatter than me. I got up and walked outside for some air. 
Around 5 minutes later my mother walked out and berated me for speaking to my grandma like that and how i should apologise. I refused and she called me a spoiled brat.

it’s been a week and my parents refuse to talk to me and my other family members are on my side

My parents think i should be the bigger person and let it go but she humiliated me infront of everyone.

"AITA for jumping out of the way when my niece and nephew tried to push me into a pool, resulting in them falling in?",16649,156xijb,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156xijb/aita_for_jumping_out_of_the_way_when_my_niece_and/,2442,"  
Happened today.

My folks decided to host a barbeque because I guess that's what older people do. I declined because I really don't like my two sisters, their husbands or their kids (wife and I are child free). Mom then pressured the wife. Long story short, we went.  
  
By the time we arrived there were about 20 people there. My sisters and their husbands were already solidly buzzed. Drunk really. My mom was spending 100% of her time trying to keep the nieces & nephews (ages 7 to 11) more or less under control. My dad had strategically retreated to the whirlpool part of the pool with small cooler full of beers. Wife and I made small talk with miscellaneous people, ate food and had a frozen margarita. Sisters/BILs took turns criticizing us for being late, not being in our swimsuits and screwing up the vibe. Whatever. Typical suburban summer get together.  
  
About 45 minutes in two of the kids ran at one of the neighbor guests who was standing next to the pool and pushed her in. She was at the pool steps, stumbled in but didn't fall so only got half wet. She was clearly very unhappy about it but she didn't make a scene, just went over to where the parents were, grabbed their towels, dried herself off and left. Sisters and BILs thought it was all great fun.  
  
A bit later I was standing a few feet away from the pool chatting away with someone. I saw three of the kids running full tilt at me from the corner of my eye. Obviously I was next. Not that it's terribly difficult to outwit young kids but I just jumped out of their way at the last second. All three of them ran straight into the pool at full speed. Most of the other guests (including my wife and me) started laughing but their moms - who as I mentioned were pretty shitfaced - absolutely freaked out. Apparently two of the kids couldn't swim even though they were in swimsuits. Since I wasn't in swim gear I stepped back from the pool and let other people fish the kids out. The kids were bawling their heads off like they'd lost a limb.  
  
At that point all hell broke loose. The four drunk parents were yelling at everyone in general and me in particular for ""nearly letting their kids drown"" and also because two of the kids had been videoing the trick using their parents' iPhones, which were now at the bottom of the pool. One of my BILs got into the pool to try to retrieve the phones but his BMI and BAC made that impossible. No one else volunteered to help, unsurprising given that my sisters were still bitching at everyone.

I told my sisters it was their job to watch the their kids and that if anything had happened to them it would have been their responsibility not mine. There were some pretty strong words on both sides. Wife and I left after the other BIL fell over and face planted while yelling at us. Now they're saying I should have let the little shits knock me into the pool and have their fun (and ruin my phone). So... AITA?

Side note: Dad, of course, never got out of the whirlpool.",1690065436.0
AITA for refusing to leave my house when my girlfriends friends are over,865,157bjm9,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157bjm9/aita_for_refusing_to_leave_my_house_when_my/,240,"Hi!

So me and my girlfriend have been living with each other for a couple of years now and generally have a really good relationship.

Most Sundays she will invite some of her friends over for lunch which is all good, but the kicker is she doesn't want me to be there and asks me to either leave for a couple of hours or just stay in another room (which is our bedroom lol - we have a tiny apartment) while she can have her girl time.

These are friends I have met plenty of times before, but for some reason she just doesn't want me there when they come over to our place. . . .Anyway, I'm kinda sick of this because I don't particularly want to leave most times or stay in another room, so today I told her I'm not going to leave or hide away.

She is now angry with me, and is wondering what is the problem with me just leaving for a while. Am I being an asshole in this situation?",1690108810.0
AITA for upgrading my house's thermostat so I could password protect it from my wife?,3306,1573qq0,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1573qq0/aita_for_upgrading_my_houses_thermostat_so_i/,4244,"My wife [26F] and I [28M] have been married for about half a year now. We lived together in an apartment before getting married and now we live in a house I inherited from my grandmother.

This summer has been quite hot and so like most people, we have been running our air conditioner nearly around the clock. My wife and I have very different ideas of how we should run it though. Using energy saver recommendations, I like to keep it at around 76 Fahrenheit and on low. My wife likes to turn it down to 60 degrees and blast it on the highest setting, then turn it off when she gets cold, then turn it back on again when she gets hot.

I've tried discussing this with her but there's literally nothing I can do or say to convince her. She currently stays at home taking care of the house while I go to work, and the second I'm out the door, the thermostat is messed with. I've tried showing her our exorbitantly expensive power bill (from May of all months so it was only going to go up) but she doesn't care. She says that she's at home all day and so she should have control over it.

We've argued about this on and off since. About three weeks ago I got a reservation for a new digital thermostat installation. The guys finally came in a few days ago and installed a new smart thermostat off our older air conditioning unit. The first thing I did was password protect it so you would need a PIN to change any of the settings. 

My wife came home a few hours after I had set the PIN and noticed the new unit. When she tried to change the settings she was met with a request for a PIN, and she asked me what it was. I told her that I wouldn't be telling her that. Then she asked what she should do if she gets hot. I responded that she can still turn the air conditioning on and off without the PIN. 

The next morning I left for work as normal, setting it to 76. When I got home in the afternoon I found my wife on the living room floor pantomiming a fainting spell. She mustered the energy to say ""Help ... water ..."" I ignored her because you faint from heat in a climate-controlled room. When she realized I wouldn't give her attention she exploded in anger and yelled that she could have died, prompting another argument. She ended it with calling me ""controlling"" and hasn't said more than a word to me since.

Things have been rough for the past couple of days. I feel like what I did was completely justified but was I an asshole about this?",1690082858.0

I’m quite open with my friends about my line of work (Sex Work) but I’m not with family and those I don’t know well. 

During the event I was talking to a group and Jenna blurts out “She can donate so much because she makes so much making porn.” I was stunned. It became incredibly awkward. I pulled Jenna aside and asked her what the hell?

She said it wasn’t a big deal. I told her it’s a big deal to me. It’s not her information to share. She tried dismissing it and I got angry. I told her to leave. It became a heated argument. 

After some back and forth I told her that at least I work for my money and don’t need a rich partner that I don’t love to get the lifestyle I want (That is true, she told me in the past she’s only with her boyfriend because he’s rich) She still refused to leave and continued to cause a scene.
Eventually I called security and had her kicked out.

After the event I checked my phone. The argument we had got recorded, but only from part way through, so the bit about my work is missing, but there is the part with what I said about her partner and her being kicked out. It had been shared within our circle a lot. 

Jenna had blown up my phone! She is furious. Apparently her boyfriend saw it and broke up with her. She told me I humiliated her and ruined her relationship.

I have no idea the reason why, our conversation on the app never got to that. After messaging back and forth for about a week he asked if I want to meet up for drink next week and if interested to text him. He left his phone number so I text him, word for word:

""Hi \[name\]! This is \[my name\]. It would be great to get together next week, how about Tuesday or Thursday? I'm down to grab a drink or up for another activity since I noticed you specified on your profile you don't drink. Let me know if what you prefer!""

His response:

""Hey \[my name\]. It is very inconsiderate of you to assume I can't handle going out for a drink just because I don't drink. There's something called ordering a non-alcoholic beverage. Consider our date no longer and please do not text me again.""

I never responded to him, as he asked me not to. It was never my intention to assume he could not handle being at a bar or around company that was drinking alcohol while he was not. Just thought it may be more fun for us to do something else. Also, I only drink 2-3 times a month so I was truly up for doing a non-drinking activity and thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to suggest it.

I told some friends about the situation and they were split. Some said I was an asshole for overcompensating and being so forward about suggesting not going to bar. They said people in recovery may be triggered by others accommodating just for them (again, I am not sure if this is the reason he does not drink). Some friends said they see I was just trying to be considerate and my suggestion was only in the best interest of both of us doing something we enjoy more.

So I went to the lounge by myself.  I had some snacks. A few drinks. A quick nap. A long hot shower. And then I caught up with my friends at the gate. 

My phone was fully charged, I was bright eyed and bushy tailed. And a little drunk. When we started talking they were bitching about the cost of everything at the airport. 

They send why I looked so pleased with myself. I told them about my stay in the lounge. 

Two of them got visibly angry. They said I was an asshole for not telling everything their was in the lounge. They had actually spent more on food and drinks than I had. Plus I got to nap in a comfy chair and have a shower.

AITA for purposedly locking my husband out of the house for getting home from partying at 6:00AM?,591,157c79e,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157c79e/aita_for_purposedly_locking_my_husband_out_of_the/,217,"I (F36) have been married for 15 years to my husband (M40), we have 2 daughters (9 and 4) and he is usually a great dad but not a good husband. He loves to party, get wasted and spend sundays sleeping while me and the girls just stay home. We have talked about this issue multiple times and he has promised to change, but hasn't. He would stay home a couple of weekends and then would go back and do exactly what he said wouldn't.
I do not have an issue with him going out but getting home in the morning I feel is very disrespectful to me, my family and my home.

Last night we had friends over, at around 10:30PM I decided to go to sleep with my daughters. At 03:00AM I get up to get some water and I notice that he is not home. I check my phone and he had texted me that he had went out with his friends and that he was on his way back.

Fast forward to 6:00AM, he still wasnt home and not responding calls or messages. I went from scared that something had happened to him, to mad that he was doing exactly what he always does so I proceeded to lock him out and asked him to not come home. He said (again) that he was on his way, but I did not open the door.
Now I'm worried that I made things worse. Am I the Asshole or he deserves to learn his lesson?

EDIT: Thank you so much for your comments, I know locking him out is not a solution, but I feel so angry and disrespected, especially because at the time he would have gotten home, my girls would have been up and would have seen him drunk/high. During the week he is very present, I work full time, while his job allows him to work part time, so he is the one taking the girls to school, teaching them sports and spending time with them. I think he is a good person, but not a good partner, I have thought about divorcing him but it breaks my heart for my girls not to have their father around. 

Edit 2: We live in the Caribbean so him passing out in the cold is not an issue, but still I know not letting him inside could have caused even more harm.",1690110951.0
AITA for asking my husband to stop peeing in the backyard?,479,157ddcs,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157ddcs/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_stop_peeing_in_the/,260,"This is so low-stakes but I’m curious what Reddit thinks. 

My husband spends the bulk of his awake time either in his office (he works from home), in the den watching TV, or in the kitchen cooking. Our house has a weird layout and there’s no bathroom right next to any of those rooms. If anyone is in one of those rooms and needs to use the bathroom, they either have to walk through our main bedroom on the ground floor and use our en-suite, walk upstairs and use the kids’ bathroom, or go down into the finished basement and use the powder room. It’s not ideal and we plan on adding a powder room to the ground floor at some point. But for now, we all deal with it. 

However, ever since the weather warmed up, my husband has started just going outside into the backyard and peeing behind the shed. Our back door is right near all the rooms where he spends time during the day so he says it’s just quicker and easier. 

I hate that he does this and have asked him to stop but he says that it’s not a big deal because none of the neighbors can see (true), nobody can see it from our house (true), our kids don’t know he does this (true) and he’s not ruining the grass because he’s just peeing in the dirt behind the shed (true).  

He’s honestly an incredible partner and father and this is literally my only complaint about him. And he’s right in that his peeing out back isn’t hurting anything. It just bugs me that he won’t take 60 extra seconds to walk to an actual toilet.

He’s the definition of a personality hire. He’s always the last to show up and the first to leave. He didn’t help with opening duties or closing duties. He shows up 10 minutes late typically. When just him and I, I end up doing the majority of the work.

He is the definition of a personality hire. When we have orders he spends his time flirting the waitress. He spends 10 minutes making a single drink when I’ll have multiple tickets finished and sent out in the time. As a result, I complete more order than him. It’s frustrating cause everyone likes him and no one notices his little work he does. He cracks a few jokes, makes a drink and then goes to the bathroom for 20 minutes. Does nothing goes on break for half an hour and then to top it off complain about how many drink we’re supposed to make.

It’s at the point where I’m pissed that I’m doing most of the work and giving him half the money. So yesterday I decided that I would keep track of all our order tickets. We typically use the same spindle for completed tickets but I saved mine to the side. By the time our shift was over, I about 3 times the tickets as him.

While he was in the bathroom during when we should be closing, I brought our tickets to my manager and showed him. I told him that I did the majority of the orders, opened, and closed. It wasn’t right for me to give him half when he fucked around for most of the shift.

He agreed and said I could split the money to better represent our work. I did 75/25 even though I feel like 80/20 was fair. He of course was pissed as he ended up taking home about 90 dollars while I took 270 and we had a huge argument where he accused me of stealing. I told him to either contribute more or take it up with the manager.

He’s mad at me, his waitress buddies took his side over mine and they all think im wrong. 

So here’s why I think I could be the asshole:

I was technically being selfish. I wanted more money for the work I do. I also don’t technically *need* the money. I’m 21 just saving money so I don’t have to get a job when school starts back up in August. I don’t have rent it bills. The only thing I regularly need to spend money on is gas. He’s in his mid 20s and has like a kid. He also works a second job so I guess he has a reason to be tired and that sucks but I don’t think that justifies him to use my work for his benefit.

I live with my dogs and we have plenty of room. 

I often let my friends and family stay with me. I work from home so I have my office in the guest house. I sometimes rent out my house and live in my guest house for months at a time. I paid off my mortgage in ten years that way.  

In 2020 right before the lockdowns my brother brought his new family to stay for a week. I didn't have any renters that week, we had talked well in advance. 

Whenever I have guests, not renters, staying with me I go in and out of my house as I please. This was an issue for my sister-in-law and her kids. They said I was not to come in without ringing the doorbell and being let in. I asked my brother WTF and he said that his wife and stepkids really liked their privacy. No problem. 

So now the pandemic is in the rearview mirror and he asked if he could bring his family again. I said no. I said that I liked being able to use my property as I wanted and that if his family needed privacy there were literally hundreds of hotels in the area. 

He said I was being a dick and punishing his family for their desire for privacy. I said they could come but that if they want exclusive use of my house they would have to rent it. My weekly rate is about $1,500. He said I was being ridiculous and that he could stay at a hotel for that much money. I said that's what he should do then. 

I got a call from our parents saying that I needed to stop being so petty and let him use the house. I told them that I would do so if in return my dogs and I could stay at his house since it is close to some really nice hikes my dogs would love. They said that my brother's wife would never agree to let someone stay in their house. I said that was a good policy so I would not be letting them stay with me. 

I got a message about a last minute rental for a few days during the week my brother wanted to come and I took it.  Now for sure he can't stay here.  

My parents and brother are pissed off with me for screwing up his vacation plans but I don't really care. 

I wasn't sure where to put this so I will just add that when I go into my house when I have guests I don't go into the bedrooms or anything. I go to the kitchen or freezer or laundry room. That's it. When I have renters I wait to do my laundry while my maid service cleans up the house between bookings.",1690117031.0

She told me what types of photos she wanted and I gave her a quote of just under 1k. Wedding happens, I take the pictures, I edit them, then wait for payment which we agreed I'd get in full after the wedding before sending any pictures. However suddenly she didn't have money and wanted to set up a payment plan to pay it off in 8 months AND still get the pictures now. It's not that I don't trust her but once you start opening such doors you'll find it hard to close them so I told her we could do the payment plan but the photos will only be released when the full amount is paid (didn't even add interest). She didn't respond. February rolls in and she asks to at least see 'samples' to confirm that they were worth the price. I sent 4 pictures and she says she'll show them to her husband and get back to me. Cue silence for a week or two until I asked for an update and she responded saying she's still discussing it with him. I told her this was getting long and she must just start paying now and she ignored me again.

So I'd saved the photos on my roommate's flash drive temporarily while I was waiting on an actual hard drive. June came around and he texted me while I was at work saying he needed to use it and took it from my room but saw that there were still files on it. He couldn't move it to his laptop because it didn't have space (thus him needing the flash) so he was 'asking' if he could delete the files. I saw fine and he deleted them. I still had about 20 of the photos saved on my phone from when I was choosing/sending the samples so I just explained the situation in a message to her and sent the existing photos free of charge.

That was last month and I'm still getting flamed for this. She's been slandering me online and it's quite literally created a division between our families and to the point that our mums don't talk now.

AITA for telling my sister the fire her kid started is her fault too?,2274,1571t4v,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1571t4v/aita_for_telling_my_sister_the_fire_her_kid/,456,"Obligatory on mobile so apologies for formatting.

My (F32) sister (34) has a son (6) who is a bit wild. He’s a cute kid, I love my nephew, but he’s a very curious kid.

This week, I got a call from my sister in a panic telling me that her garage was on fire and the fire dept was trying to put out a blaze on her car.

I got over there as soon as I could and by the time I was there it was almost all out. The garage was burnt out, so was her car and some wooden pallets on the ground.

When I got a chance to talk to my sister she was shaken up but okay. I asked her how it happened and she told me my nephew started it. He told her he was playing around with the lighter and some cardboard in the garage and thought he put it out, but clearly hadn’t put it out correctly so he didn’t notice it spreading as he went to go do something else. A couple more minutes had passed and my nephew went back in the garage, noticed the fire and called for my sister.

When she told me this I honestly could not believe it. She was writing it off as an accident and trying to shrug it off but I kept pushing her on it.

Why was the lighter out for him to reach? How did he know how to even use the lighter? (I honestly don’t think I could use one properly until I was 11) Where was she while he was alone in the garage?

She didn’t like this line of questioning and told me to knock it off. I didn’t want to give her the third degree (no pun intended) after she and her family were shaken up like this but I didn’t like her calling it an accident.

I told her that while my nephew had some blame in this because he started the fire, she also was to blame because she left the lighter unsecured in a place where he could reach it. She called me ridiculous and asked me if I could really expect her to lock up lighters in her home just because of her six year old.

I said yes, I could. I have a two year old and keep a locked cabinet for fire starters and chemicals, and I make sure the knife drawer is child proofed. (I got a little paranoid about these things after she started to walk)

My sister started cursing me out and demanded I leave and informed me she reprimanded her son but wasn’t going to punish him and that I was out of line for suggesting it was anyone’s fault.

I’ve tried to press my sister on details since she’s now calmed down since the fire, but she won’t give me many. Just the vague “I stepped away for a second and this happened”.

It’s also worth noting that some of the fire damage spread to her neighbor’s property. It wasn’t extensive, but the fire did encroach on their property. If the fire dept hadn’t come sooner, it would’ve burned down both my sister and her neighbor’s houses.

My wife, who can be hot headed and when she gets to that point she will say or do anything, loses it.

My wife goes on this tangent about how crammed into the uniform our daughter is, how bad she looks, then finally demands our daughter tell us what she weighs. She says 228. My wife then asks what she weighed in May. Our daughter says 206.”

Wife freaks out, tells our daughter she’s basically gotten 25 pounds fatter this summer with still some summer left to go.

I too then spoke up, told my wife to stop this ranting and work on helping us find a family solution.

I said that I was shocked too but we aren’t going to get anywhere ranting and raving about overhanging stomachs and butts.

He's a nice kid but unfortunately, as I found out a few days ago, a chronic bedwetter. That evening when we had dinner, he drank this tall glass of water with some chips. The next morning he wasn't up in time for breakfast so I checked his room and found he'd wet the bed. And not for the first time, when I confronted him about it he admitted he'd wet the bed before but hid it from us by getting up early and washing the sheets. Now, neither of his parents told me anything about this, and Zack told me he'd fooled them into thinking that he'd gotten over it and could I please not tell them.

I wasn't too mad because I understand it's not something he can control, but I did make a rule that he has to limit his fluid intake (no sodas, soft drinks, soups, etc.) and that after 7:00 P.M he can't drink any beverages. He's free to break the rules of course, but if he wets the bed again and I find out, I made it clear I'm telling his folks. 

My wife and I got into an argument over it when she found Zack was still awake at like 4:00 A.M. Last night. She's insistent that he's scared to sleep because he might wet the bed and it's because of the “threat” I made to tell his parents. Now, I don't know if she forgot what it's like to be a teenager, but they stey up at bizarre hours all the time. It's not necessarily due to the bedwetting at all, and I told her as much. If he's following the rules he probably won't wet the bed anyhow. She called me a “cold motherf'er” and has been giving me the silent treatment since.

I don't think I did anything wrong; it's not a “threat” per se, telling parents is just the right thing to do if a kid keeps having issues. AITA?",1690081141.0

She is against all animal cruelty and suffering and it is one of the main things I admire her for. I have 2 kids, Cassy(7F) and Chase(5M). 

My sister’s wedding allowed kids, I was very grateful for this as I’m seen as the, “overbearing mom” I don’t like having babysitters since they’re just randos who could do god knows what to my kids, but it also was made clear that it was a vegan wedding. 

Chase has been going through a phase where he picks one food and sticks with it for months, I have tried to offer him other foods he likes during these times but he just wants his chosen item. If he does not get it he ends up throwing a huge tantrum, I don’t support his behaviour and try and steer him away from it but sometimes it gets tricky.

His chosen food this time was sausage rolls.
Knowing this I knew that if he got fussy at the wedding he would cause a disturbance. Cassy also tends to want things that her brother has but usually gets sick of them after 2-3 weeks.

 I had packed a lot them since if her brother had ate them all then Cas would’ve started an uproar.

Everything was fine until I got asked by my son if there were any sausage rolls, I had given him some and asked Cassy if she wanted any but she declined as she had gotten tired of them fairly early. 

I still had a lot left over since combined they ate a truck load.
One of the guests, sister’s friend Matt, must’ve seen this since he came over and asked me for one. I didn’t think much of it and handed him one.

I’m not sure if this is important or not but not many of my sister’s friends are vegan or even vegetarian.

A few minutes after Matt had came up to me two more people did. I had declined this time because it felt a little rude, But the friends left with an annoyed expression.

My daughter had come back up to me after playing with the other kids and changed her mind and wanted some. I let her grab some then she ran again.

My sister then came up to me and was glowing red, she started going off on me about how it was her wedding and how I couldn’t just hand out non vegan food to others since it was disrespectful. I tried to explain to her that it was just for my kids but when she had told me that, “no one else’s kid’s are acting like this they’re all fine with the food maybe if you were a better parent Chase wouldn’t be in this phase to begin with.” 

Like I said earlier I’m a bit of an overbearing mother so when she had said that I just snapped. I yelled about how her closest friends didn’t even like her food (most of the food was prepared by her) and some other immature/hurtful things.

I got up and left with my kids, arguing while walking out.

My sister has blocked me on everything and our parents&friends are calling me the asshole for walking out on the wedding over something so small and that I should just apologise, but until she takes back what she said about my kids I’m making 0 effort for her.

When it came to my birthdays growing up, she’ll find a way to make it about herself. When it was my 14th birthday, Flora faked a panic attack causing my parents to shift their focus on her. I never had a birthday to myself since Flora had to be in the spotlight.

I begged my parents to not invite Flora since i didn’t want to share the spotlight with her. My parents assured me that she’s finally matured and how it was a sister thing.

Floras grin quickly went away when people noticed my negative reaction.

When my current wife and I decided to try to have children, I made it very clear that I didn't care what her choice of delivery was, but c-section I would not enter, but that I would stay by her side at all times except for operation. She agreed and eventually became pregnant. 

She decided in the middle of the pregnancy that it would be a c-section and I said that was fine, but I remembered my limitation. She understood and invited her mother to take my place. 

On the day of the surgery, before she had an c-section, she asked me to come in with her, because she wanted a moment of our own. 

I apologized, but that this was my limit and that I couldn't. She said ""Fine, I'll go with my mother then"" and had a crying face. I tried talking to her but to no avail and my MIL kept looking at me disguting.

Anyway, I don't think it would have been a hell, because I was very nervous and it definitely wouldn't have helped at all inside the operating room.

 Everything went well and our daughter was born beautiful and healthy. I was already at the exit of the operating room waiting for them and I didn't leave their side.

Though I am studying an Arts degree, my university requires arts students to take some science classes, so that we can be well-rounded. I didn't like science very much in high school and took one computer science class in my first year, so I'm taking my second science this year. 

This year, the biology department is offering an Ornithology class, or the study of birds, for arts students. I decided to swoop up a seat in the class because I love birds and I would love to learn more about them. 

At my family reunion (Father's side) yesterday my grandmother was asking me about my classes, the only one who seemed genuinely interested. I listed off my English classes and then told her about Ornithology. She looked at me weird and so I explained the word. Her eyes opened wide and she asked me how to say it, so I taught her. She didn't finish high school but always wants to broaden her vocabulary. 

She got it on her second or third try and I repeated it with her once she got it. She laughed and thanked me for teaching her something new but she had to check on her garlic beans which were roasting on the BBQ.

 I was sitting down when my cousin sat next to me. He also dropped out of high school. He glared at me and said ""So now miss fancy university is using words we can't understand.""

I asked him what he meant and he responded, ""You know you shouldn't use big words like that in front of family, you just think you're better than everyone else here because you're going to a big fancy school.""

My wife had a fit though, she got in an argument about teaching her guy chores. That she is too young ( the other two kids started before she age). I told her that she needs to stop babying her and that she needs to know who shit works. She called me a jerk and left.

AITA for not going to a BBQ that was meant for me,386,1577cgh,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1577cgh/aita_for_not_going_to_a_bbq_that_was_meant_for_me/,94,"      My husband 27m and I 27f are very antisocial and we both hate crowds and being around people. Our wedding had a total of 20 guest since we only invited family members we actually liked and very close friends which is very few for both of us and to us that was a lot of people. A while after we got married our families gave up on inviting us to their parties and get togethers since we would never show up simply because we didn’t want to they would invite us out of courtesy but we know they never expect us to show.

   We recently bought  our dream house in a very nice neighborhood. and this is the issue, last Thursday during my morning run before work my neighbor lets Call her Amy saw me and signaled me to stop so I did. 
She pointed out that she noticed we moved in a couple weeks ago but didn’t introduce ourselves and she wanted to get to know us. I told her my name and she told me Hers, she then talked for like 5 minutes About the neighborhood and neighbors etc. I cut her off politely saying I had to get to work but before I left she mentioned a “neighborhood bbq  on Saturday where everyone was welcome and suggested we go. I told her thanks for the invite and jogged to my house 2 doors down. 


       My husband was up and while we were getting ready I told him about it. He asked me if I wanted to go but I said not really too many people. He laughed and agreed and we went on about our day. Saturday came and we went to the gym and then for groceries  but that's it, the bbq didn't even cross our minds. The next day again on my jog Amy stopped me, she didn’t look happy. She told me that me and my husband ruined the bbq. I asked how since we didn’t even go and she said exactly. I was confused then she said it was supposed to be a welcome to the neighborhood BBQ for us and we didn’t even bother to show. I told her sorry since I didn’t know but she started babbling about the time and effort and whatnot. Again I  told her if I would have known I would have gone but she called me rude and disrespectful and stomped into her house. I jogged to my house where my husband was waiting with coffee. I told him about the encounter outside and he was weirded out by the welcome bbq  saying who even does Things like that then said oh well we didn’t know so not our fault. I agreed and just went on about our day. 

     I called my mom and during the conversation I brought it up she said we should have gone at least for an hour or so to not be rude and I reminded her of how she used to scold me when she would take me to gatherings and I would have a “face” because I didn’t want to be there I told her that now that no one is forcing me to socialize I won’t do it. She called me a brat and our conversation ended. I know I’m not wrong cuz I can’t be forced into a situation I don’t want but my mom is making me overthink so am I the asshole?",1690094586.0

We have never been close as she criticizes me for earning more than her brother and emasculating my husband who is a SAHD. I run a daycare (for kids for kids 3-5 yo) after starting work there as a preschool teacher. I bought the place from my boss and have been running it since. I had to get qualifications as a teacher and get certifications in first aid/health and safety stuff, background checks for me and my staff etc. 

My SIL recently split her husband and they have twins, 6f. She works freelance but since having the twins has worked less to focus on them. She has full custody and decided to start being a childminder, picking up the twins' friends after school and expanding her business. 

She asked me to promote her business to parents from my daycare, and I declined, we have never been close for her to ask me a favour and I told her I felt uncomfortable promoting her, as her business was illegal as she didn't have any qualifications or checks done to run a business. She said that she was saving up to get them done as they were quite expensive and she didn't have the time right now. I encouraged her to take more freelance projects and stop the babysitting until she got her checks done. 

I found out recently that she has taken on more kids from the twins' classes and is continuing being a childminder. I anonymously reported her and her business has been shut. She yelled at me on the phone for shutting her business down and called me petty for not being able to put my differences aside and let her suceed.

My husband is calling me TA though, as he told me his sister is going through a lot; her ex had an affair, he doesn't pay child support and she is struggling with money right now. I had no idea, but I told him I would have reported her regardless as what she was doing was unsafe for the kids she looked after.",1690115459.0
AITA For not letting some random child play on my laptop?,385,1575unp,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1575unp/aita_for_not_letting_some_random_child_play_on_my/,106,"This just happened a few minutes ago.

 I'm on a passenger ferry to go visit my parents (I usually do this once every month or two) and it's about a two hour sailing so I usually bring my laptop to watch shows or game. It's a large ferry and there is an area with cubical desks that have power outlets for people to use. The ferry has no Wi-Fi service, but I simply use my phone as a tether on my data.

 So I'm playing Call of Duty with my headphones plugged in and out of nowhere this kid ( I'm guessing he's about 7 or 8 years old) runs over to me, puts his hands on the desk and just stares at me screen as I'm playing. I glance at him and shift over slightly because he's riiight in my personal space, standing less than an inch from me. I could hear this kids mouth breathing. He just stood there. I take my headphones off and look at him and say ""Uhhh hey buddy do you mind? Where's your parents?"" He looks over at me for a second and turns around and YELLS "" MOOOM I wanna play CoD!""  I was shocked. I turn around and this woman is standing behind me. She says ""No honey, that's not yours, but you can watch him play if you want"" At this point I'm super uncomfortable and this kid is still standing an inch from me. He makes a face and again YELLS "" MOM I WANNA PLAY!!!"" At this point people are looking at us and I'm getting pretty annoyed. The woman looks at me defeated and says ""I'm sorry but is it OK if he plays for a bit?""  I couldn't believe she felt entitled enough to even ask. For context, I have a high end gaming laptop and I would never let some kid put their grubby hands all over it.  So i replied "" Uh Sorry but no. Do you mind asking him to not stand so close?"" She lets out this sigh and says to her kid ""OK honey lets go this man wont let you play"". ""MOM I WANNA PLAYYY!!!"" She looks at me again with pleading eyes and I simply say "" Sorry but No, this laptop is expensive and I'm not letting some strange kid touch it""  Now the kid looks like I cancelled his Christmas and begins SCREAMING ""I WANNA PLAYY, I WANNA PLAYYY"" The mom grabs him and drags him off but no before giving me a sneer and says ""It wouldn't have killed you to just let him play for a bit"" As if I'm somehow responsible for her shitty kids happiness.  

As they walked off some of the other passengers were still watching and I saw a few of them were giving me disapproving looks. So I packed up my shit and went back down to my car. AITA?

She has a boyfriend (21M) who goes to school with us, but my bestfriend decided to go home for the summer so its just us. Her birthday is coming up and her boyfriend  suggested that we fly out to go see her, which I was excited to do. We started making plans and it came time to book the tickets. None of us are rich but they absolutely have more money than me, and it stressed me terribly to spend $500 on a ticket anywhere. I still bought it, because she is my friend and she means a lot to me. The two of them had been planning the trip without me and I was excited to see what they'd planned. Once we all got on Facetime, I realized they planned one on one time every single day and I would be left in the city with no friends for hours on end. She didn't plan anything fun for just the two of us to do together. And on the first night, they plan to go on a walk together and leave me in the house with her parents and siblings (who I have never met) because they think the meet up would be anticlimactic if they didn't get alone time. 

Needless to say, I was furious. I know I am just the friend and he is the boyfriend so he gets more time, but at the bare minimum I expected one thing blocked off for us to do. I felt like some sort of glorified travel buddy for her boyfriend and I didn't spend $500 just to do that. After the Facetime I wrote them a text letting them know I didn't think I was comfortable going anymore. I still planned to send my friend's birthday gift to her house, but I did not want to go on the trip any longer. She immediately began back pedaling and saying we could change the plans, and I rebutted saying she knew that I'd been coming for weeks and it just was not a priority to her to factor any time with me into her plans.

I've talked to some of my friends about this and they agree, saying I shouldn't go there just to sit in a foreign city by myself. Others have said I was too harsh and should've just toughed it out.  So AITA?",1690037354.0

What garbage was taken out was left next to the house, even though there is a dumpster.  I found a few of my things in the garbage that they had stolen from me.

After all of that, they decided to not pay their portion of cell phone bill and not the payment on her phone that was financed through me.

We have a 1 year old boy together, Nick and I have a 9yo, Mark from a previous relationship. Joe has Sara 19f and Lucy 16f from a previous relationship. 

We planned a week long vacation, Sara and Lucy were invited but originally declined. They decided at the last minute to go, so we had to rearrange accommodations for them, which is fine. The girls and my husband shared a suite, while me and the boys shared a queen bed in a regular room. 

During the trip, every day my husband took the girls out to eat for every meal but did not invite me and the boys to join them. I'd call and ask where they were and it was always at some restaurant, theme park, movie, arcade, bowling or something. I was feeling left out and basically stranded at the hotel. 

The next to last day, I found a waterpark in walking distance from the hotel so I took the boys for the day and got them treats and souvenirs. Joe called while we were there and asked what I'm doing, if the boys are enjoying the hotel and I told him we're at the waterpark right now and going to see dine in movie afterwards. That set him off and he started yelling at me for not inviting him and the girls. That Sara and Lucy love waterparks and going to the movies, and I know this so I should have made sure to include them. Joe then told me I'm a heartless bitch for excluding them and he'll make sure to treat Mark the same way from now on. I tried pointing out that I've been left at the hotel with no car and not invited to anything this whole trip. Joe said that's different because he only sees Lucy a few times a month and Sara once a month if that, because she's in college 2 hours away from home.

Joe ended up extending his and the girls time by 2 days so they could get 2 days at the waterpark, to make things fair. We're all back home now and he's giving Mark the silent treatment, calling me cruel and a bitch, and barely doing anything with Nick.

I initially agreed because I was told it would be temporarily. We live in a small apartment and it is very crowded we have a child of our own too. Our household went from 3 to 5. I can’t even spend time in our living room because they are always watching TV before I make it there.

I have explained to her that I do not feel comfortable in my own house and she said she’s going to look after her siblings and if I didn’t like it I can figure it out.

We don’t live together and she lives in an apartment so we usually host these dinners at my place. In addition to the regular group, she invited a friend she made at work. While our friends group is quite diverse, her work friend is the first Thai person to join the group so we were all excited about the potluck she would be bringing.

When everyone was there, we started to heat up the various potluck dishes then sat down for dinner. Everything was great and the conversation was lively. GF’s work friend said that she brought a sticky doron rice dessert (not sure I spelled it correctly, I sounded it out). I was very excited because I love desserts and love trying new food. Toward turn end of the meal, the people who brought desserts brought them out. 

When her work friend opened her container, there was an overwhelming odor that hit everyone at once. Some of the people who sat closest to the container covered their nose and some of the people who were still eating gagged. My best friend choked and cough so hard she had to run to the bathroom. I told my GF’s work friend I think her dessert went bad and she tasted it and said that it was fine. She said the smell can be different but it’ll turn sweet once it airs out. 

She was wrong.

It got worse and worse to the point most everyone was standing in the opposite end of the room as far away from her desert as possible. I suggested she take her dessert out to the porch and whoever wants it can go out there and get it. My GF jumped to her friends defense and tried to get me to shut up all the while holding her finger under her nose to keep from smelling the odor. After a few minutes, I couldn’t take the odor anymore so I got up and moved the dish out to the porch.

This embarrassed the friend so she left. My GF yelled at me in front of everyone and told me I was being dramatic and culturally insensitive. I argued it was smelling up my house. She demanded I try the desert before I say anything but I told her I’m not eating anything that smells like that.

I might have embarrassed her friend but I think I was justified in moving the dish that the smell still lingers in my house this morning. Was I wrong?",1690112388.0

The issue is I haven’t showed much emotion towards it. I’m still in shock and denial. I put up a pretty good front with my emotions and I’ve just gotten used to feeling them in private and putting on a brave face, of course I loved my mum and I am mourning her but I just don’t like crying in front of people. I am always open and honest about how I’m feeling but this is a feeling not easily described. I’ve never lost someone close to me. 

When my dad asks me how I’m feeling I just say  “sad” or “I don’t know”, in a more articulate way. But yesterday he tried to provoke a reaction from me, saying stuff like “you’re never gonna see her again” “you’re never gonna hear her voice again” “aren’t you sad??”, and I just snapped and said “fuck off, you’re a fucking piece of shit, you don’t know how I feel” and I feel like I really hurt him. 

He even admitted to trying to poke and prod to get a reaction out of me because “crying is good for you”. It’s the fact my mother JUST passed away and he’s sitting there trying to make me feel worse because he thinks I don’t feel sad about it because I don’t shed a tear in front of people.

I can handle the job fine as long as everyone does their job properly. 

We have a bell that we use to tell each other when orders come in and once they're ready to go out. It's a loud bell and makes a clear sound that even I can hear fine throughout the building. Almost all the bartenders here use it just fine. But one of them has an issue with using it with me. She refuses to touch the bell and instead comes back and says, ""DING!""  Often not even loudly enough for anyone to hear it, let alone me. If I'm in the kitchen, I can see her and I can hear ok if the person is only a few feet away and speaks clearly but I'm usually the only cook during my shift so I have to step out to run to coolers or to the basement. So if she's just making noises with her mouth, I'm not going to hear that. And then she gets mad every time this happens for ""not doing my job"" and costing her tips for food taking longer. 
I've told her to knock it off. Probably every shift we've worked together over the past month. And I've been very direct about it; ""I can't hear that, ring the bell"". She straight up refuses to listen and now I've found out she has no problem with the bell with the other cooks. She uses it every time. So I'm positive she's just doing it to be a jerk about my disability (she's been mean about my other disabilities in the past too). 
So I finally told her I'm not cooking anything for her unless the bell is rung, even if I'm in the kitchen and see her. She didn't believe me and came in 10 minutes later and says, ""DING!"" And I just kept working on making the soups for that night. She came in again a few minutes later and goes, ""I said DING!"" And I ignored her again. So she said it again and I still kept ignoring her. 
After another minute of her waiting she starts just loudly, almost screaming, chanting, ""DING! DING! DING! DING! DING!"" It was honestly hilarious and all the customers can see into the kitchen from the bar and got to watch this. 
Anyway after she did that for about 30 seconds and then she figured out what I was doing and turned and hit the bell. So I immediately stopped and made the order and sent it out. No complaints at all from anyone that it took a few extra minutes, customer even complimented their burger.
But she threw a fit over it to other coworkers saying that she looked ""stupid"" in front of the customers and that some of them were laughing about it (she probably looked even more ridiculous without any context) and some of them are saying that it was mean to do and that I should apologize but I don't feel bad at all.

My family from all over the world regularly visit and stay with us. In return, we stay with them when we visit their cities for various reasons (work, vacation, etc). 

Last year I had to travel to the city where her brother lives and she decided to come to visit him and his family. She asked if we could stay with them and he declined because he’s still protective of his family due to the world event. I understood at first and we stayed at a hotel but later got annoyed because they had no problem going to dinner and out with us in public. Earlier this year I had to go back to his city and again she came along to visit them. He again declined her request to stay at their house so we stayed at a hotel. I understand some people just don’t like to have overnight guests. The visit went smoothly and everyone had a good time.

Last week he called to ask if he and his family could stay at our place when they come here in a couple of weeks for their vacation. I got really annoyed at this because he didn’t let us stay at his house but wants to stay at ours. I told my fiancé they can stay at a hotel but she argued that they would need 3 rooms for 7 days due to their family size. She then pointed out we always let my family stay with us at which point I countered that is because we’re always invited to stay with my family whenever we visit their cities. She argued family do things for each other without expecting anything in return. We went back and forth until bed last night.

I’m sitting here having coffee while she’s sleeping and I’m unsure if I’m wrong. On one hand, I know I can be stubborn and petty. On the other hand, he doesn’t invite us to stay with him while expecting us to house him and his family.

What do you think?

Update to answer questions:

1. We have a 4 bedroom house along with many air mattresses. Once we hosted 10 of her college friends when they had a get together. People slept in the living room and dining room. They also have a 4 BR house and we would have been happy to sleep in the living room. We’ve slept on an air mattress many times at my family homes.

2. All of his kids are over 10 and his wife is bringing her sister along and she needs a BR of her own. No one in his family have any disability or condition.

3. Our house is near many of the attractions they want to go to. Due to the popularity of the attractions they want to go to, hotels and house rentals close to those attractions are more expensive than normal. Also, our house is close to shopping and restaurants.

4. My fiancé just told me whether they stay with us or not, she’s letting her brother borrow her car for the week so that they’ll only have to rent 1 car. That means we’ll have to carpool that week. This is even more annoying as that would add about an hour to my daily commute.

5. My fiancé is a better person than I am. I can be very petty when I’m annoyed which is why I usually take cues from her and go with her decisions in certain situations. In this case, I’m very annoyed which is why we’re in an argument.

6. When it was just me traveling to her brother’s city, my company was paying for a hotel room. When my fiancé decided to tag along to visit her brother, she asked him to stay so she could spend more time with her nieces and nephews.",1690026009.0

Violet is the daughter of my sister, Emma (f27).

Yesterday, I took Kayla to see the new Barbie movie as a treat for her 11th birthday, which was actually a few days ago and I planned it with my brother.

A few days ago, Emma found out about these plans and asked if I'd take Violet as well, because she loves Barbie. I said that she and Violet are welcome to tag along and she said no, she's not coming, only Violet. I gently said no because respectfully I want to relax on my day off work and enjoy the movie and I don't feel like watching Violet. Not only is she younger and less independent but she's autistic and can be quite a handful (I didn't say this to Emma but she knows). I could see Emma was getting annoyed and she said I'd only be watching Violet during the movie and its only such a small ask. I told her no and that's that. She said I'm excluding Violet for no reason and that I'm playing favorites, and I don't have to deal with Violet being sad that she can't go see the movie with us, but said I obviously don't care because I'm so selfish.

This upset me a lot and I told Emma to just drop it but she won't, and says that I never offer to babysit Violet but don't have an issue taking Kayla to activities.

My brother got involved and he said to Emma if she wants me to spend time with Violet so bad she can bring her own daughter to the movies with us and pay for their own tickets. This all snowballed into a massive family rift as my parents got involved too and said that Emma has every right to be upset and I should just bring Violet and that it would make Violet really happy.

I ended up only taking Kayla and she had a blast but this situation has gotten me feeling so crap and I just need to know if I really was right or wrong.",1690034786.0

She seemed very happy with this, fast forward 2 years and we finally moved in together. Once again, the conversation of buying a Borzoi dog game up, I kept deferring it making up excuses such as the flat is too small, we’re too busy and so on.

I tried prolonging it out by saying not yet, and bless my girlfriend for her patience she kept sighing and leaving the discussion. Then Covid came and one of the very few perks of Covid were that dogs became extremely expensive and that became my new reason not to buy the Borzoi dog. I milked the excuse during covid but now Covid isn’t affecting dog prices… so her obsession with getting the Borzoi dog has returned.

I should now explain why I don’t want a Borzoi dog. Simply, they’re the most hideously creepy dogs I have ever seen. It’s face makes me incredibly uncomfortable and I cannot imagine having one in the house a running around. It reminds me of the slender man but as a dog. As ridiculous as it may seem, I fear it. My girlfriend thinks the complete opposite. 

It has now become a so much of a obsession she has started buying Borzoi cuddly toys, framed pictures, electronic cases, kitchenware, decoration, ALL Borzoi themed. The Borzoi dog has taken over my house and my girlfriend. We haven’t argued over it yet but my girlfriend genuinely is heartbroken that I won’t get her one. 

She’d cry when binge watching videos of them and it would break my heart so a couple of months ago I finally explained my utter disgust of Borzoi dogs, I explained how the Borzoi dog genuinely disturbs me. She said she that I lied to her all these years promising her the dog, I led her on and that if she didn’t get the dog then she’d consider leaving me. I don’t want to lose her but I can not bring myself to live with a Borzoi dog. 

AITA for telling her that we’re not getting a Borzoi dog?",1690122666.0
AITA for charging my pregnant cousin for a new wedding dress after she told me about her pregnancy last minute?,34,157grof,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157grof/aita_for_charging_my_pregnant_cousin_for_a_new/,36,"I 29f own a bridal shop. My cousin Lucy 27f is getting married in 2 months and I designed and tailored her wedding dress as a gift. She paid me for the materials. It will take another week to finish the dress, and I constantly update Lucy on the status of her dress and asked if she is happy at every stage and if she had any more ideas. She would make the odd comment, but never anything major. The dress in total took me just over 4 months.  
  
Last weekend, her and her fiance hosted a family dinner, and at the end, Lucy announced she was pregnant. At the dinner, I congratulated her and her fiance.  
  
She came to my store with my aunt that week for her final fitting. I again mentioned the pregnancy and asked how far along she was. She was 12 weeks along and told me how hard to keep the pregnancy a secret. I told her the dress wouldn't fit her at 20ish weeks during the wedding and she said she knew and asked me to retailor the dress to fit her new proportions as she would showing heavily at the wedding. I told her I can't do that due to the intricate beading that I will have to carefully remove and reattach. I told her she might as well get a new dress as it would be easier for me to start from scratch and essentially I was just making her a second wedding dress.  
  
She agreed and then I gave her the invoice for a new dress. I gave her a breakdown and charged her for materials, tailoring, labour and overtime (still with a discount). I will have to work outside my hours to make her the new dress on time as I have a busy schedule with existing clients that pay full price. I told her if she had told me about her pregnancy from the second she had found out, I might've been able to adjust the dress then, but it is complete now. She said her fiance wanted to keep it private, which I understand, but I wouldn't have told anyone, and I only needed to know for the dress purposes.  
  
She called me TA for not understanding where she is coming from and said she will only pay for materials. I refused to back down, and told her that this close to the wedding she will struggle to finalize a new dress she likes and get it tailored in time as she will be pregnant. I also refused to give her the dress sketch, as it was my design and I didn't want her to replicate my work elsewhere. She left angry with her mom who later called me up to say Lucy is upset about not having a dress this close to the wedding and that I am being cruel because this stress is not good for the baby.",1690123820.0
AITA for calling my parents out on how much they paid for my sister’s wedding?,4536,156j4um,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156j4um/aita_for_calling_my_parents_out_on_how_much_they/,1386,"Throwaway account. This happened 6 months ago, but I am legitimately curious to see if I am the AH. I (36M) got married 6 years ago to my wife. My wife’s family is not well-off like mine. When we announced our engagement, my parents gifted us 20k out of the blue for the wedding. We were shocked and so thankful. The money paid for my wife’s dress, my/her siblings wedding party outfits and makeup, and the venue/food. We managed to have a small, beautiful wedding and even had 3k left for the honeymoon. I am beyond thankful for that money and know that we would not have had our wedding without it. Plus, being able to pay for her family’s outfits and makeup really helped lessen their financial burden.

Here is where I need to ask if I am the AH. My sister is getting married and I just happened to be at my parent’s house and got into wedding-talk. My sister was going on and on about all the plans. I come to find that my parents agreed to shell out 35k for the venue and cut her another check for an additional 20k for other expenses. My sister and her fiancé are both doctors. These expenses were outrageous to me because I have been married and know it can be done significantly cheaper. I went to my mom and asked why she allowed my sister to pick such an expensive venue and there was time to find another one. We made our wedding work off 20k, how can she excuse my sister’s being 3x the cost? My parents are retired and in their late 60/early 70s. She told me that my sister’s future husband’s family were high-class people and have certain expectations. I asked what that meant and she said that they couldn’t be expected to have such a meager budget like my wedding was.

I was floored. I asked her if she thought 20k was a “meager budget” and what did that say about what she thought of my wife and her family. My mom said I was making a big deal out of nothing. A woman’s family pays for the wedding, my sister was just having an expensive wedding and it is none of my business. I agree that it is their money and they should spend how they want, but that high-class and meager budget comment has been eating at me since. It seems to me like my mom is saying that my wife was lucky to get a wedding because her family is not well-off. I haven’t mentioned this to my wife because she does have insecurities about how my parents feel about her and it might hurt her. Am I the AH here for calling out my parents on how much they are spending on my sister’s wedding?
EDIT: A lot of the same questions. My parents did gift us the 20k when we said we wouldn’t be able to afford a big wedding, as my fiancé’s parents were not able to help. We did not go into this engagement expecting a cash gift for the wedding. We planned to have a small wedding and we had one without going into debt. That would never have been possible without my parents.
The other question as to whether I want the additional 35k, of course not! I was making a point to my mom that it was sooo much for a wedding.",1690029662.0

My (40m) 3 months pregnant wife (36f) goes on an annual trip with her girls. I’m ok with that. About 3 months ago she asked me if it was ok if she went to Cancun with her girls for 4 days. They have little to no international travel experience and she has zero situational awareness. When traveling before she has requested Uber rides to places that the driver wouldn’t even stop at to try a restaurant. 

I told her I didn’t want her going to Mexico because I didn’t trust she would just stay at the resort and to go anywhere in the US. She has had a miscarriage before and I worried that any complications outside the country could be disastrous. That was the end of the conversation. 

2 weeks ago she informed me that she was going to Cancun and it has been booked. She left this morning. I have been beyond pissed off about it. I believe it is reckless and unnecessary. 

This is the 2nd trip I have said no to. The first was in July of 2020 when she was also 3 months pregnant and covid was in full swing. 

She called me controlling and an asshole before she left.

AITA for agreeing when my dad said he's a terrible father,82,157amft,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157amft/aita_for_agreeing_when_my_dad_said_hes_a_terrible/,50,"I'm literally shaking while writing this, I can't really think straight right now so sorry for any grammatical errors, anyways for some context my (18F) parents divorced when I was 4, since then I haven't really seen my dad a lot, he would visit me for my birthday or father's day but he always brought his girlfriend and her son to go too, as a child I didn't really think about it because I saw her as my father's friend and her son as a potential friend of mine. 

But then when I turned 13 he completely stopped visiting me, I tried reaching out to him in any way I could, I sent a friend request on Facebook, I tried messaging him on my mom's Facebook, I tried calling him, his brother, his sister, hell, even his girlfriend, but he would just ignore me like he never even knew me. 
I ended up just giving up, it was hurting me too bad, well, years later, at 2022 he sent me a message on WhatsApp (I got his number from my uncle during 2018 but he blocked me when I tried messaging him), he sent me a single sentence and wouldn't talk to me until a year later, the message was just to say my grandmother passed away from covid, that's all, he wouldn't respond to any of my messages, which I thought was fair, his mother just died, so I accepted, though I was hurt.

That's a lot of context, sorry, anyway, back at 2023 he finally sent me a message apologizing for not being the father I deserved, I was so overwhelmingly happy that he was giving me attention, now rereading the messages I realize all he did was talk about how his life was hard and how he couldn't find a job and his now wife is pregnant, his stepson, he, he, he, but at the time I didn't care because he offered to be part of my life again, which I happily agreed, we started messaging each other every day, but I notice just now he would never listen to me or how my life is going, my hobbies, nothing! It was just him, again, I didn't care.

Then my 18th birthday came, and he promised he would take me out to a Hello Kitty themed cafe I loved, I was so happy, my mom was happy for me too and even helped me pick a good outfit, I started waiting for him, but he didn't show up, I sent him messages asking where he is, but he didn't respond, I felt like I was 8 again. Months later, just two days ago he messaged me and started his rant about how sorry he is and how busy he was that day and that he's so sorry, he then said ""I never do anything right, I'm such a terrible father"", that's when I couldn't stay silent anymore and replied ""yes, you are"" and just blocked him, his wife ended up calling me and just calling me names and saying how my dad is ""trying"" and how I've always been ""selfish"", I couldn't even say anything I just cried until she probably got tired and hung up. 

I've been crying constantly since then, my mom tried to comfort me but I just want to disappear, now I feel like I ruined my chances of having a father, maybe I shouldn't have said that, AITA??",1690105766.0
AITA for telling my mum it’s her fault the family is upset?,43,157e8x5,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157e8x5/aita_for_telling_my_mum_its_her_fault_the_family/,21,"I (24f) am expecting my first baby with my partner (28m). Currently 16 weeks along and we kept it quiet until 4 weeks ago until we had the scan and testing to make sure everything was okay etc.

I told my mum first since it will be her first grandchild and the first great grandchild in my family. Naturally she was excited and told everyone within days which upset me slightly since I asked her to keep it quiet and that I wanted to tell people myself.
My aunts and my mum have always had a strained relationship. She has three sisters and my whole life she has been arguing with or has fallen out with all of them for extended periods of time over stupid things (they always make up in the end because apparently that’s what sisters do) but this means myself and my cousins never spent much time together and we are all basically strangers to one another.

This brings me to last week , my mum calls and asks when and where I would like a baby shower and I told her I didn’t. She said that was crazy and that my aunts were excited and even said they would all like a scan picture from my next appointment and wanted to know how I was doing my gender reveal.

This was all overwhelming and I told her that a baby shower wasn’t happening because it didn’t interest me. I reminded her that only two pictures were given at scans and the rest had to be paid for if I wanted more and that I was happy to purchase one for her and my grandparents but that is it and as far as gender reveals to my partner and I had planned something intimate between the two of us and we would just tell everyone else when we were ready.

She was upset by this but left it alone. That was until today when she called me and tried to push the idea of a shower and gender reveal again saying my aunts and cousins were upset that I didn’t want to include them in my pregnancy and that I should really think about how the family feels.

I exploded which I regret slightly and told her that her constant arguments with her sisters when I was growing up meant that I didn’t know my aunts or my cousins well and that my pregnancy (again this is my FIRST) was something that I wanted to enjoy with the people closest in my life. I told her I was happy to bring the baby to my grandparents once a week after I have settled into motherhood and that everyone is welcome to come and be part of my child’s life and that I am not trying to cut them out of it but since they are practically strangers to me I wanted to do everything at my own pace.
She got upset and cried saying I was horrible for accusing her of making me feel estranged from my family and now she isn’t answering my calls.

I know I shouldn’t have snapped but the last few weeks I feel like every decision surrounding my pregnancy has been taken away from me. I didn’t get to announce it to anyone except my mum and now I’m feeling pressured into trying to please everyone. So AITA?",1690117145.0

The first part of my birthday we had some people over at our apartment for a little celebration for me with food and cake and some drinks. Not a lot of people, a couple of his friends and family members and 2 of my friends. Everyone left around 10:30pm and at that point my boyfriend had decided to go to bed. I wasn’t tired and wanted to celebrate more so I told him I was going over to my 2 friends house (the 2 that were at my celebration) for a few hours and I’d be back later. He seemed annoyed but I left anyway. I came back a few hours later and he was SO pissed that I was gone saying I know he doesn’t like to sleep alone and how dare I not care about his feelings (I do care, but I should be allowed to go see my friends) and go see my friends making him fall asleep alone. He then proceeded to tell me since he had to spend 3 hours alone in bed with no cuddles I had to sleep on my side of the bed and he’d cuddle me in 3 hours just so I know what he had to go through. He said it wasn’t about me seeing my friends, just the fact that he had to sleep alone for a few hours and it’s not fair to him. I even tried to cuddle him and he pushed me off and said don’t cuddle me , so I moved to my edge of the bed and fell asleep. He could have came to my friends house but he refused. Things like this happen all the time with him but this one is still bugging me weeks later. So Reddit, aita?

EDIT TO CLARIFY: my two friends are women. We left when he went to bed to not keep him up as he’s a light sleeper. He also said at first he didn’t mind if I left but he already seemed angry as I can tell and he was lying to me saying he was fine with it even though I knew he wasn’t but I just wanted to enjoy the rest of my bday. Also him and I spent all day together 8am to 6 pm when people started showing up. We had also had a fight the night prior and he said he ruined my birthday and I told him he didn’t if we could just go to sleep and have a good day the next day which was my bday. We have so many fights I don’t even remember what that one was about I know it was over something stupid.

EDIT #2: Thank all of you for your comments and advice, after taking everything in our relationship and everything I’ve read on here today into consideration I’ve made the decision to leave him. I have nowhere close to go as no one in this area has room for another person, so I’ve already made arrangements to stay with my mom 2 states away. I just have to actually get all my stuff out and myself out safely. Idk how he’s gonna react-this isn’t the first time I’ve had to leave someone that imo could or has gotten violent- I’ll provide an update on how that goes and when im at my moms. Again thank you all I really appreciate the words, some of them I really needed to hear to push me to the best decision for me. Cause this is just one incident, one fight, things are not good with us at all even though right now it’s good I know it’ll be bad again in a few days.",1690054615.0

I lost hearing over the years with many ear related incidents. I wear hearing aids to hear people talk sometimes but I mainly use them at school. When I start I school year I tell the teacher that I wear hearing aids and they normally put me next to their desks so I can hear them without the use of my hearing aids.

In one of my classes I have a girl lily. Lily likes to yell at people to get them to come to her instead of getting up to talk to them. No matter who tells her to stop she won't. The teacher stop trying to get her to stop a pong time ago.

In this class  we have to take notes. Lily missed notes day and the teacher told her to find someone with notes. No onwe near her wanted to give he the notes so she chose me.

I was on the opposite side of the room and she began yelling at me. She has done this all year and it was annoying. I didn't look at her. I just kept working on other school work. I wasn't going to give her special treatment because she was lazy. (She had no mobility issues. She just doesn't want to walk to other people)

She kept getting louder and more frustrated that I wasn't going to her. She yelled at me for 10 minutes before she stood up and walked over to me. She was very mad at me and kept saying that it was stupid that I didn't go to her and that she shouldn't have to stand up. she very loudly asked ""what are you deaf?""

The entire class was watching us. (I have no idea where the teacher was) I slowly turned to her before taking out the case that has my hearing aids in it and made a show of putting them in. I then very loudly asked her ""what?"".

She got very red in the face and then turned around and walked back to her seat. No one in that class knew I wore hearing aids because my hair covers them. 

My sister said it was mean of me to do that to her because she didn't know and I wasn't wearing my hearing aids and I could hear her because she was very loud.

I'm the second oldest, I have an older sister Marina (50F), and a younger sister Helen (46F). 

Around five years ago, Alex's ex-wife Natalie (47F) cheated on him and they split up. It was a very sad situation as Alex adored his wife, but she wanted someone who was present more as he is a heart surgeon and his job is demanding. 

Around this time, Alex started to struggle with mental health problems and went down a dark path for about a year. He hired a housekeeper, Sara (18F at the time 23F) now who fired after only three months. Back then he claimed it was because he didn't want to be lazy and he wanted to take care of his own cleaning/cooking, but we recently found out that it was because he got her pregnant but he didn't believe the child was his. He refused to do a paternity test and essentially left that poor young girl to fend for herself. His excuse was that she was a recovering addict and he was ashamed that he had gotten involved with her, but I don't understand why he would have hired a recovering addict in the first place if that was going to be such a big deal with him.

Somehow, he recent got back into contact with her and found out about his four year old son. He panicked about it and told the family. He said that he was going to send child support and see his son weekly, but that he wasn't going to introduce the boy to his 14 year old twin daughters with Natalie and that the boy wasn't going to be a part of our family holidays. He introduced Sarah to our family and although she seems fine now, she struggled a lot when he abandoned her as she had no friends or family to support her. Her situation reminded me of how we grew up when our father abandoned our family and it made me sick to know my brother had done the same.

I told him that it was wrong for him to treat his son like a dirty secret just because he's embarrassed about how he behaved. I host all family holidays and gatherings because no one else is organized enough  and I said that I wanted to see my nephew there or I would stop hosting because that child deserves to know where he came from. My mother and older sister agree with me, but Helen and Alex are calling me the asshole for trying to 'dictate' how he handles his life. AITA?",1690042550.0

My wife Hailey (F29) and I have been married for six years. We have two kids besides my stepdaughter Sophie (F10), a two years old toddler and an eight-month-old baby.

My in-laws live 2 hours away from us by car. We didn't bring food for the trip to avoid messes in the car. But there were a few accidents on our way and due to the traffic, the 2 hours became 4. All the kids were starving when we got there. Our toddler and baby popped themselves along the way. So when we arrived, my wife went to give the toddler a quick bath, and I went to take care of the baby.

Sophie is LCA blind. Yes, she can help herself in our kitchen like any ten-year-old. But, since she doesn't know my in-laws' kitchen, we told her to wait on the sofa and that we would make her something to eat as soon as possible.

While we were busy with the little ones, my BIL Andrew (M31) arrived with his family. They are going to spend the weekend here as well. Sophie probably complained to Andrew about being hungry, so he gave her some leftover food he had from his trip.

Later, Andrew came to us and tried to start an argument about how I was neglecting Sophie. I tried to de-escalate the fight and explain to him the whole situation, but Andrew was stubborn. My in-laws were out buying pizza for everybody (as we had previously arranged) while the fight happened.

Even after dinner, Andrew didn't calm down. While he hung out with Hailey, he kept talking shit about me. Andrew said I'm an inept parent and only love my children. My wife asked me to brush over his behavior because he's always overprotective about Sophie. For example, he pays a nice private school for her while his kids attend public school.

PS: Sophie's dad was kept out of the picture because he wasn't (let's say) a good person. At least, that's what Hailey and Andrew told me. I never met him.",1690076709.0

I also hate birthday parties because i a have a phobia of balloons(loud noises scared me when I was a kid and the kids at my school would sneak up behind me and pop balloons to scare me, so now they kinda freak me out)

Okay, main story: 
This takes place two years ago in January. I had just relapsed and none of my family knew about it yet and it was a few days before my birthday. My sister and I have always been close to one another, but sometimes she overstepped her boundaries. Most people knew about my phobia of balloons, including my sister. I had to beg her every year not to throw me some kind of ridiculous birthday party. I get that she was just being nice, but i really didn’t want it. 

Anywho, she decided that year that she was going to throw me and party anyway. The night of my birthday, i was meant to just have dinner with my parents and sister and her kids. When I walked into my parents house it was pitch dark and when I turned the lights on about 20 people jumped out and yelled “surprise!” I, being under the influence of several different drugs, threw up when they jumped out at me.

When I was done being sick, I was so mad at my sister. She knew I hated birthday parties and did not want one. She started yelling at me about throwing up on my moms floor and stuff. We argued for about an hour and all of the people that had come for the party left.

This is the part where I think I may be the asshole. When I finally decided to leave, before I walked out the door I told her that I never wanted to see her again. She took those words very seriously and I have not seen her since that night. I went to rehab about a week after that happened and I’ve been sober since.

My in-laws were also invited to this wedding; which includes his parents, his two sisters and their husband/boyfriend. 

They were all throwing around ideas of staying in the same accommodation together. I’m not very close with them, as even though I lived with them for a short while, I had to move out again because I was constantly having my privacy and personal boundaries violated; e.g. closed door being opened while I was getting changed, coming into the bathroom while I was in the shower (had no idea that the lock didn’t actually work), going through my personal belongings, etc.

I told my fiancé that I wasn’t comfortable staying with them, because it meant a full weekend where I would feel anxious about what would happen and by the look of the house that we were going to stay at, I wasn’t sure there were even going to be enough rooms. The last time that we stayed in an accommodation with them and there weren’t enough rooms, we ended up on a blowup mattress in the living room.

I booked us a seperate room and told him that I would feel more comfortable with that arrangement. He agreed and I thought that was the last of that. 

Come to today, he called me to tell me that his sister was asking for our share of payment for the house. I was confused and reminded him we were staying somewhere else.

AITA for refusing to change my vacation schedule to fit my sisters vacation schedule?,51,157afrq,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157afrq/aita_for_refusing_to_change_my_vacation_schedule/,11,"I (31 f) just recently put in for vacation from work for a family reunion. I put in for the dates I was given and then my sister (46 f) told me that the reunion was happening a few days before that and that she's leaving to go home the day me and my mom arrive and that she really wants to see us because it's been a few years. 

The entire reason we're having this family reunion is because we found my mom's biological mother and we all want to meet her. 

(My moms dad took my mom and uncle when my mom was an infant, and took them to live with his mistress several states away.)

My mom told her we could arrive before noon so we could have lunch together but I told them both no because I work nights and will be exhausted and because our check-in for our rental isn't until 4 p.m. We're also bringing our cats with us due to the cats having anxiety, three of them were abandoned by their previous owners, and because one of them is my emotional support animal. I don't want to leave them in the travel carrier longer than needed and it is already a five to six our drive.

I love my sister and would love to see her as I haven't seen her in five and a half years but I also refuse to give into her demands again. She always wants me to come visit her for the winter holidays ignoring the fact that we're required to work the winter holidays at my place of work, which is a residential facility. She refuses to visit me even though she's more financially stable, I always have to be the one to come to her. 

I did ask if she could extend her stay by a day but she refused stating that she has to be back at work two days later and has a longer drive compared to me. It will take them at least twelve hours to get home. 

While I would love to see my sister I can't change the dates I put in for vacation and our rental is already booked up until a couple of days before our stay and they require the unit to be empty for at least 24 hours for cleaning between stays.

AITA For not wanting to feed my friend's kids all the time?,24,157er76,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157er76/aita_for_not_wanting_to_feed_my_friends_kids_all/,31,"Me (31f) my friend Anna (30f) and her 2 kids (6/3)

We are neighbors and friends, she is a kind and wonderful person, always happy to help and I'm happy to do the same for her, the only issue is how comfortable her kids have gotten in my house. 

I understand they are growing kids, and I'm happy to give them a snack now and then, but it's turned into 1 of them trying to go in my fridge for cheese, or begging for chocolate milk or snacks, what have you. If I give 1 cheese, the other wants half a jar of peanut butter, then her sister wants crackers to eat the peanut butter when she is done with the cheese. And it's just gotten to where I feel like I have to say no, or limit their intake, because they will hoover up groceries that are supposed to last my husband and I a few weeks. Or drink half the milk I have put to the side for my customers (we run a farm). 

Anna is great about enforcing my no, or telling them no herself, but I just feel like I'm being a bad friend for with holding food from kids. They aren't short on anything at their house, there's no extenuating circumstances or food shortage. 

I just wish my friend would bring some dang snacks for her own kids rather than letting them be hungry, or telling them to just hang on for 2 hours and then they are whining about being hungry until I feel bad and give them something.

Edit: she will sometimes have a bag of chips or something in the car for them, but they still ask for me to give them something too",1690118537.0

I'm also 5'9 so I model a little bit. My family is quite conservative and they all lives in the same town we grew up in, while I'm the black sheep they always make fun of, for anything and everything I do.&#10;  
I tried cheerleading but got rejected as I was taller than everyone, joke is that I'm a boy that's why they rejected me, I got degree in computer science and works in a big corporate, I'm the ugly boss bitch. Post pics with a new hairdo, I look like a man and the people who hit on me are all gays. Like I stopped caring about their comments, but they just find a way to shit on everything I do and it gets a little overwhelming at times. After moving out I'm not in contact with them.&#10;  
I live in a big city in a small apartment with my dog, recently I got an opportunity to walk a runway, it's not a big show, but still a big deal for me. I was very happy as one of the person walked with me was a very big model, although we didn't interact I was very happy to be in the same event as her. Before the show they took professional pics of all of us and I thought my pictures were very cute, so I posted a few and a lot of people praised me but my dad and brother posted laughing and the man emojis. One pic I was topless but covered myself with my hands, the focus was my abs and my bracelet. I thought I looked cool, but they started commenting like what's even there for you to cover and all the nasty things, people who didn't know they were my family tore them apart in the comments but I felt bad, so I disabled the comments.&#10;  
A few weeks later there was a party at my aunt's house, she is my favourite, so I decided to stay a few days after the party. One day I was hanging out by her pool in a really cute bikini which I got from the event and was just happy while my family showed up. I tried to go to my room to dress up, while my aunt tried to hold them by the door to give me time to leave, but they just entered and when they saw me they just started laughing, telling me bikinis are for woman not l**y***s, I was like so shocked as this is new low even for them, but once they got the reaction out of me they started saying all kinds of things to hurt me, but I was like fuck it and took off my tops and started sunbathing like my dad and brother. There was a big silence for almost 5mins and my aunt started laughing and told me to put on sunscreen on my chest area and I did and suddenly there was a huge commotion like everyone was yelling at everyone, so I was like what's even there to see as I have no boobs, while my dad and brother has dadbods, huge boobs with a beer belly. They slut shamed me and left, I didn't care and my aunt didn't care but My sister messaged me the next day telling me to never contact them again and what I did was very disrespectful etc. Now that it's been a few days I'm wondering, as I did subject them to unconsensual nudity and made them uncomfortable.",1690044290.0
AITA for leaving My (F21) boyfriends’ (M21) family vacation after 12 hours?,23,157e7ni,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157e7ni/aita_for_leaving_my_f21_boyfriends_m21_family/,69,"So my (F21) boyfriends’ (M21) mom (F50) rented a beach house. I was invited long before but didn’t really want to go because I knew I would be jet lagged from my vacation that was scheduled before his for my dad’s birthday. I ended up agreeing to go upon his insistence, for 2 days, right after a 6 hour flight. It was a 7 hour drive to get there. 

When I get there, his mom speaks to me as little as possible, which is nothing out of the ordinary. She’s decided that she “doesn’t approve of me” I think because she invited herself to my grandpa’s funeral who she never met without asking me (a whole other story). 

All is fine though until about 9, when everyone decided to call it a night. I went upstairs which was by her room to get a snack where she asked me if I needed anything to get ready for bed and suggested that she needed to go to sleep so hopefully our show wasn’t too much longer. I was confused because I didn’t really think I would have a bedtime (at 21 years old) and was even more confused about why she couldn’t sleep until I did. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and thought possible she was worried I would wake her up when I went to sleep since the couch was right by her room. 

Anyways, I’m not tired and slightly annoyed that she’s treating me like a toddler. I usually could go to sleep around 10, but I just got back from a place that was 4 hours behind and didn’t really think I could sleep. I go up there around 11, still slightly annoyed but trying to make the best of the situation. I tell her goodnight while looking right at her sitting in bed with the light on and she ignores me. Weird, but whatever. Then she turns off the light and leaves the door open, quite literally watching me while I sleep. I’m beyond being nice at this point, and I just go close her door. She opens it again. I tell my boyfriend what’s going on and he comes and closes it and it stays shut. 

The coffee maker comes on at 5 am the next morning. No one warned me, and I was started awake and couldn’t go back to sleep. His mom gets up about 7:30 (so why she would want two hour old coffee is beyond me) and was super cheerful, nice and enthusiastic when she saw my boyfriend around. At this point I’m like “screw this” and packed up my stuff and put it in the car to leave.

Now my boyfriend is mad at me for “ruining his trip” by leaving. He also says I’m being an asshole by expecting him to defend me and therefore creating tension on this trip. Maybe I’m still angry about being watched like a toddler while I sleep or her fake behavior towards me when my boyfriend is around, but I don’t really how me staying would’ve led to it not being “ruined”.",1690117040.0

At the end of the night my friend tells me the cab company won’t drive out to the country venue and there is no cell service to call an Uber.

My roommate(21F) and I (24F) have got along so well from the jump. Bedsides some small cleanliness issues on her end, we get a lot really well. We’ve lived together for about 7 months now. We met from a mutual friend that is a flight attendant. My roommate is gone a lot and i deal with a lot of house chores alone. ( not not say it bothers me) however my roommate made friends with a friend flight attendant, and the friend and I DO NOT GET ALONG. I don’t mean to be dramatic because I never have problems with people in general, however hers and my personality do not mesh. My roommates friend has been over a lot recently. Which bothers me but that’s her friend.

Tonight they went out and so did I. After getting back I wanted to wash my laundry, I saw that there was clothes in the wash so I added a pod to it as we normally do (since she’s gone often I usually add to or do laundry or keeping up based on what is left behind) after they gets back after a night out……..the clothes are entirely ruined. Her friend insists i pay for her clothes as she left a red lipstick in the shorts pocket of her clothes and it ruined the laundry. I usually am supper calm but this time i went off… she began talking down to me and yelling when it truly was just a mistake. After getting treated so crappy i stopped and i said “i feel so bad that that happened however you shouldn’t  have left that in the clothes” it’s not that seriousand the damage is already done. She insisted that I pay her back for the new clothes that she had just bought and “how dare I wash the clothes without checking because if it was her she was going to check the clothes before she washed them.” I told her this is our home. I wash the laundry when things are in the washing machine, so I’m sorry that happened, but I’m not paying for things. Her friend has been washing her clothes in the sink very vigorously and very dramatically and this proves the point of why her and I do not get along. Am I the asshole for refusing to pay for the clothes that she ruined with her own lipstick that she put in the washing machine?

Update: this happened last night. I got home from work today. My roommate was gone and had left for work. As I walk into the apartment her friend is there showering doing her own thing like nothing happens. I had thought about it all day and texted my roommate her friend needs to leave. I was screamed at and belittled the night before by her and refuse to be around people that treat me that way. She left after I told my roommate.

For context: I (26F) adopted my cat Toby about 7 years ago, and I love him to pieces. I moved in with my sister (31F) and her family (BIL and daughter 6F) between finishing law school, taking the bar, and moving to another state for my job. I contributed to utilities, and groceries, cleaned up after myself (and for everyone one occasion), and took care for my cat. The plan was always to stay from May 20th to August 5th. It’s been an overall great time, I spent a lot of time with my sister, BIL and little niece through the last 7 years as they live in the same city as my undergrad/law school. We get along great, and my niece is wonderful! She is my sister’s rainbow baby, which has led her to be a little coddled through the years. 

The issue: my niece has taken quite the liking to my cat. He’s a very friendly cat, and loves pets/cuddles/etc. The other day, we were all eating dinner together, and my niece was talking about how much she loves Toby. I didn’t think much of it so while helping my sister with dishes said “cats are wonderful, maybe you should consider adopting one!” She made a strange face and said “what do you mean? we have Toby!” I explained to her that I meant after I move out in the next two week. My niece came to the kitchen holding Toby during this conversation, and my sister said she loves him too much, “you’re going take a child’s cat?”

I was extremely upset by this conversation but kept cool and said “well Toby’s my cat” and I was never intending to leave him here. My niece instantly started sobbing calling me a “cat robber” and saying that no cat will be like Toby bc Toby is hers and he loves her. I kinda just grabbed Toby and went to my room.

This was a week ago, and I have received texts and calls from my sister, my mom, and BIL saying I’m being childish towards a child. I suggested I go with them and adopt a cat, but my everyone insists on letting my niece keep Toby and telling ME to get a new cat. I’ve put my foot down, and stated there’s no world in which that happened - to which I’m being called an AH.

Initially, I told her I will come and can stay with a friend who lives in Manhattan. The only thing that we discussed was that they will go to a nightclub on the 4th. She later texted me “We are getting a table” and asked me to send a pic of my driver’s license to make the reservation. At the time, I thought it was for a table at a restaurant for dinner before we would go to the nightclub (when in reality, it was for a private table at the nightclub). Since we would be up late in the night, I also asked her if I could crash with them instead of my friend place and she said of course.

So I land in New York and ask her where she is staying. She calls me then and tells me that the costs for hotel room per person will be $300 for the weekend and the nightclub is $350. The room will be shared with her and her 2 friends. I anticipated that the room would be <$100 after splitting per person and also realized that the nightclub fee includes the private table that I gave my license for and bottle service. She called back and told me everything was already paid for including me (bed and club table fee). I was a bit upset that she never told me the costs ahead of time and paid before agreeing on everyone's budget. Because I have a friend in town close to the hotel + I don’t drink, I told her I'm not comfortable paying that and can do other activities with her during the trip. I went to my friends place and met with her and her friends for dinner at a fancy restaurant they picked for that night. The bill ended up being $150/person and we went to a smaller club that was $100/person. I went back to my friends place after and crashed on his sofa.

The next day, I met with gf at a coffee shop and she was upset that I put her in an awkward situation with her friends, who were upset that they have to cover for a empty hotel bed last night especially after I was able to spend on fancy dinner and club last night. I asked how I can help and she asks me to cover the full $300 for the hotel bed. I felt conflicted because I didn’t use the room and why she couldn’t just pay with her friends who are all working and have higher budget than me as a student. To avoid drama, I told her I will pay for it but will then have to miss the $350 nightclub with her on July 4th. She said ""that's fine, that's refundable"" and said it's more important that I pay for the hotel room, which hurt me that she was not empathetic for me paying for the hotel and deciding to spend the 4th alone.

Since our curriculums tend to involve lots of outdoor activities and physical sports, many of our training events for our employees take place at public parks/community centers. 

Last week, during one of our events we were outdoors at a local public park. It wasn’t a very busy morning, so we were using 4-5 benches and tables as well as some field space. This has never been an issue and we’re mindful of those around us also using the park. We often bring promotional products like tables, banners, balloons (solid blue for our company color) to obviously represent the company. Usually after these events I pack all of our gear up but I will give out the balloons to kids playing at the park, with their parents permission first. I’m not the creep going around saying “hey kid do you want a balloon” when I was giving out some of the balloons to kids who’s parents approved, I was approached by a man who looked maybe 21-25ish, but for the context of this story I could immediately tell that he was either on the spectrum or had some sort of developmental delay. I work in education and this is something we often work alongside and offer programs in as well, so I saw the signs. He ran up to me with this huge smile and his face and asked if he could have a balloon too, and I handed him one. The way I looked at it, he is an adult and in a public setting I didn’t see harm in handing him a balloon at the time.

About 30 seconds later I was approached again by this same man but with an older woman who I now know was his aide/paraprofessional who just ripped me a new one for giving him a balloon, and not knowing boundaries, being inappropriate, should have asked her first, etc. 

When he approached me she was nowhere in sight, which I don’t exactly hold her at fault for since I know it’s not uncommon for adults with such disabilities to elope, but I really didn’t mean any harm by giving him a balloon. I guess I didn’t initially view the situation as inappropriate since he was an adult. AITA?

Soon thereafter, I was spammed with literally hundreds of junk emails, presumably to hide the travel notification and credit card payment (it was pure luck I found them). I immediately notified my credit card company of the fraudulent charge and was assured I would not be held responsible.

My financial security now protected, I turned my attention to the flight booking itself. Strangely enough, it still showed as active and the first leg had already departed. Since I had full access to the online booking, I could cancel the remainder of the flights---which is exactly what I did---and those travelers would now be stuck in their connection city.

I shared my story with a good Indian friend. She told me purchasing flights with stolen credit cards was common BUT those traveling were rarely the thieves themselves. Indeed, the thieves usually sold heavily discounted tickets to others for cash. So I may have deliberately stranded a family in a strange foreign city out of spite. AITA?

My sister (21 f) is getting married in our parents' country.A little backstory: in our country, before the main wedding event, we have a bunch of little parties at home leading up to it. 

We flew to our parents' country and one of the small parties before the wedding was being hosted by my aunts and grandma. They all asked my sister what theme she wanted and suggested a theme of everyone wearing their old wedding dresses. In our culture, some people actually show up to the actual wedding in their wedding dresses but I have been pretty vocal about how that is messed up seeing as how I grew up in America where people don't even wear the same color as the bride to respect her.

Knowing this, everyone repeatedly asked my sister if it would be ok for them to wear their wedding dresses on a smaller party before the wedding instead. She said she had no problem and that it was such a cute tradition. I got my sister alone after this conversation and asked her if she was sure. She promised me she was and said she was excited to see me in my wedding dress again. I told her that I don't want to, seeing as how I was recently married and I don't want to take any attention from her. She responded that she would get offended if I didn't wear my wedding dress because I wouldn't be following the theme and it would look like I wasn't happy for my sister.
On the day of the party, i found another dress and called my sister to let her know that I wanted to wear that one if possible because it wouldn't take away from her spotlight and also because l'm pregnant and it would be more comfortable for me to wear. She told me to stop being annoying and to just wear my wedding dress like everyone else. 
So I wore my wedding dress. At the party, A bunch of my family teared up when they saw me because I had gotten married in America and it was their first time seeing me as a bride.
At the party I noticed my sister was reserved and quiet around me but she was complimenting and dancing with everyone else. 

After everyone left and it was just my grandma and parents, she starting screaming at me and crying. She said that I took away the spotlight and that I shouldn't have worn my wedding dress and that i should accept that she is the bride and not me.  I told her that I only wore it because of her, and she denied it and said that I was just jealous of the attention she was getting. 

My parents are angry with me. My sister posted on her fb that I wore a wedding dress to her wedding and all of our friends in America are appalled and saying that they don't want someone like me in their lives anymore.My parents want me to publicly apologize to her for ruining her special day but my husband said that it's not my fault because I repeatedly asked her before.

AITA for not giving up an already paid taxi ride to a disabled person and his family?,11,157fygb,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157fygb/aita_for_not_giving_up_an_already_paid_taxi_ride/,23,"I work a full time job and also attend university (I study on the books at home when I have time, but I do not attend the lessons as in Italy it's not always mandatory), all of this while my father, which lives with me, is legally blind and while he does not need much care, he needs on the other hand a lot of assistance.

I've been feeling drained for a long time, but last week I got my shft scheduled in a way that basically gave me two consecutive rest days. Basically, I would have worked the night between Thursday and Friday, going back to work on Sunday afternoon.

&#x200B;

So I decided to book a hotel stay in a sea town for me and my father. After working the night, I rushed home, took my father and our luggage, then went to the train station and took our train.

Then I realized that what for me would have been a 15 minutes walk from the train station to the hotel would take at least twice the time for my father, considering that I would have to physically guide him. I just decided to use an app to book and pay a taxi ride for us, and once we got off the train, there it was, waiting for us. I was sure it was ours because it was the only one there, being it a small station in a small town.

&#x200B;

Then it happened: ""Oh, look, a taxi!""

This couple, with the man on a wheelchair, and their two sons spotted our taxi and went for it.

I tried to rush at my best, considering that I was giving the arm to my dad and he walks considerably slower. ""Excuse me, I booked a taxi ride and given this is the only one around here, I believe this is me""

After a quick chat with the driver, he confirmed this was indeed my raid.

""Excuse me, why don't you just leave this for us and take another taxi"" - ""Because I have reserved this ride for me and my father and already paid for it"" - ""But HE'S ON A WHEELCHAIR!!"" pointing at her husband.

Now I just told them they could call a taxi by phone and would arrive within minutes, I offered to call it for them, told them that my father was also disabled and that I still had paid already for the ride.

She just replied that I was rude, that the taxi fare was nothing for me so I could afford to lose that money and let them use the ride because ''disabled'', and that my father could still walk, despite the 35°C and the fact that he's blind, while her husband couldn't (which was true, but at that point I didn't care anymore). All this time the kids were fairly silent as much as the husband.

&#x200B;

I ended up telling my father to hop on the taxi and sternly told the lady that that was MY ride, and that she would have had another taxi already had she just called rather than fighting over mine.

She again called me rude and unsensitive.

Now, I'm pretty sure what I did was right, but I still cannot just disregard the stress having a disabled family member is, and that a ride could have been a help and relief for them as much as it was for me and my dad.

Recently my brother left  my mom's house and he is currently living at my aunt house until the end of this month. Little context my brother is lazy with zero drive to do anything. He lived with me back in 2016 for about two years until I moved to Texas and he moved in with my mother. He is 26 now has been living with her for 4 years and a year with my aunt. My mother has been blowing up my phone because I refuse to let my brother stay at my house. The last time I let him stay I paid for all expenses while he was working and got nothing for it, but his ass to kiss and when I brought the situation to my mother she condoned his actions. (calling it a bad mood, side note my mother has always taken his side no matter what) my last straw was him trying to fight me because I told him I wanted him to move out after constantly paying for his bills and personal items. So after a fight he finally left. 4 years go by and every now and again I'm still paying for something.(she would disguise it has something she needed) That catches us up to this past week. My aunt is moving and she has told my brother he can't come to her new place, that he would have to move out, so he goes to my mother house and that last about 5 days and he leaves because he doesn't like her rules. (Trust me stupid I know) so now he's back at my aunt house a couple days before she moves to her new place. I being the big brother call my grandparents and they give him six months to try and get some money together and move out. I informed him that he would have six months to get his life together (after having 5 years to do so) he send me a sob message back saying it's everyone elses fault that he doesn't have his life together and that's hes basically 26 and homeless. Saying he was promised that his name would be added to the house that my parents bought. Well that didn't happen and he is putting the blame on them.  saying that because they promised him 4 years ago that they would add his name to the title, that's the reason he didn't save up and doesn't have his life together. well Recently my mother asked me why I haven't offered him to come stay at my house. I explained to her that I can't be concerned about him and I can't continue to pay for his expenses and he can't do whatever he wants in my house. Well she didn't like that to much and said that since I have the space and no one is living with me he should be allowed to have my spare room because we are family. I still said no. The last text between me and her was her telling me ""if your brother stops talking to you over this it's your fault"" my response was ""if he stop talking to me over this it says more about him than it does me"". Sorry if this story was all over the place. But that is where we are right now he is currently trying to find a place to live by the end of this month. (with no saving)",1690057484.0

Two weeks after the funeral we had a small family get together for my husbands bday which we did every year and my SIL who was pregnant at the time decided to turn his party into her gender reveal since all the family was together- the problem being my family was also to attend as well as my sister who was still morning the loss of her child as we all were-luckily my sister was late to the party and I was able to get rid of the gender reveal evidence before she got there- I found my mom in the back yard crying she was apologizing saying she just needed a moment- I cried also bc it was all so fresh and we were all still trying to come to terms with the loss of our nephew/grandson/ son. I was upset and told my husband who agreed it was insensitive but said his sister just didn’t understand and it wasn’t meant for it be mean. 
     Fast forward a few months ago his sister (45) tells him she had a miscarriage a few months prior and had to have a dnc and how awful it was. I empathized and sent condolences- a few months after that I (30) found out we were expecting. It was a huge shock as we weren’t actively trying- but always welcoming. We told his family and no one seemed the least bit happy. His sister later told him it was insensitive of us to get pregnant and to announce it knowing what she went through about 8 months ago now.

I got a job, not so well paying but at least I can pay my bills and monthly expenses. It’s important to mention that this money can only sustain me as it’s not a lot. I try to do extra jobs on the side to supplement my income and at least save for the rainy days.


For context,I come from a really toxic family. Both of my parents are.I don’t remember a time I could sit down with my dad or mom to talk about something because it would later be used against me.I grew up in such a toxic environment that I have been conditioned to keep stuff to myself and find it really hard to speak up, consequently affecting my relationships with other people. I would rather ghost than talk about it. I am so affected that I panic at any loud noise or even when I see an incoming call from my mom /dad,I instantly start asking myself what could be the problem because I have been conditioned to think it’s just a problem or something bad and I’m the cause or subject. The trauma is just so bad but I’m in therapy working on myself.


Back to my point.Ever since I started trying to get some money for myself,my mom has been constantly demanding that I share my income with her.Sometimes even telling my grown aunties(her sisters) to get money from me.Mind you,I only make enough to sustain myself. I really wouldn’t have a problem giving her some money,but I don’t make so much to be able to spare any,at least for now.I have a younger brother in college who I send some money to,whenever I have some to spare but I have noticed she encourages him to ask me for money whenever he wants and blasts me for being selfish when I say I can’t help.Anytime I say I don’t have money to spare,I’m reminded that she paid my school fees with her money and I owe her for everything I have.She’s asked me severally what I do with the money I make and I feel really frustrated sometimes. Like I’m just trying to be a functional adult who can look after themselves for heaven’s sake! Sometimes she says very nasty things, reminding me of every single mistake I have made in my life and how I am a potential failure.


I am so tired of the mental abuse,I have consolidated my savings and I plan to relocate to another country without telling anyone of them when my lease ends at the end of this month.I just feel like moving far away to a new environment will help me heal and start all over again.I have started getting rid of my social media and in the process of changing my phone number.I have left out so many details but I can’t explain the damage this has had on me and I just want to take back my life and make myself happy.

AITA for not wanting to babysit my cousin's kids?,6,157i49y,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157i49y/aita_for_not_wanting_to_babysit_my_cousins_kids/,13,"When I was little, I used to see extended family at Christmas and Thanksgiving, but for some reason, that suddenly stopped. We no longer had big dinners, visited, or talked to other family. I grew up with just my immediate family, and my grandmother and grandfather on my mother's side. 

Due to this, I barely know any of my family, and my mother gets really upset with me when I say I don't care about extended family. She will mention aunts and uncles and cousins, and I won't recognize any of the names. I just don't understand why I should care about people who I haven't even seen in over eight years, especially since it's not my fault I stopped seeing them (I was young and had no control over being in contact with other family). 

Well, my father's aunt's daughter's family (I think I got that right) is coming to visit soon for an event in town. I think she counts as my cousin? Well, she has a husband and two kids under four. I went to their wedding maybe six years ago (only because my father was invited). I haven't seen or talked to them since. As my mother is telling me that I need to help clean the house for their arrival, she told me I might need to babysit their children for them while they're here (she doesn't know if I actually will need to, she's just anticipating it). 

I told her I wouldn't be babysitting the children. I have two part time jobs, and not to mention, they're not my kids. I didn't get a choice in letting these people stay in the house, I don't even know them from a random stranger on the street, and I don't care if it's selfish that I want my days off to be spent doing something other than more work. Usually, if I'm not working, I'm sleeping. My mother got upset with me and said I was expected to if needed. 

I don't hate children. I used to babysit when I was younger - but the kids I babysat were all over five years old. Also, I know I can't handle children for more than a few hours at a time.

I have a younger half sister, who will be a junior next school year. She isn’t a bad student, mostly B’s and some A’s, sometimes one or two Cs. She passed her ap classes this year. She has her own studying habits, which is just studying and doing work during other classes so she doesn’t have to do it at home (unless she has to). If it works for her, it works for her. She only gets in trouble because shes always on her phone in classes, or has headphones in.  I’m not close to my sister at all, we rarely talk to one another.

Recently, our entire family visited our grandparents from my dads side. I got congratulated by my cousins. My sister spoke up and said stuff along the lines of “Well its not like op actually worked for it, she just got lucky. Its all genetic.” Which annoyed me, I studied, i work hard. I don’t like the fact my achievement is brushed off as luck.

So I said something like “Its not luck, I worked for it. you could work for it to if you weren’t always doing something else like using your phone all the time or listening to music. Its those problems holding you back”

AITA for not thinking I need to move my alcohol,16,157bw82,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157bw82/aita_for_not_thinking_i_need_to_move_my_alcohol/,36,"Hi, ok so I'm kinda pissed and either need to be talked down from my anger or have it validated.

Kinda long, sorry

My roommate and her ex have been broken up for a few months but they still hang out/sleep together, go on dates... Their whole relationship was kinda toxic and this also isn't super healthy. He was over at our house 24/7 when there were together (which I didn't love because when she wasn't home he was still here and I never felt liked I got to be alone in my own space) but now I have a hard rule he can't be there when she's not. I do not care for this guy at all. When he's here we don't acknowledge one another because while he's her guest, to me, he's not welcome. 

Here's the main issue. He's a not so successful recovering alcoholic. He doesn't do anything to take steps towards recovery. He's gone to like one AA meeting and no therapy because he doesn't think it will help him 'i just need to get some self restraint and I'll be fine' he also still drinks, it got to a point that when they were still together she'd mark the bottles in our house to see if he was sneaking pulls in the middle of the night (he was). I know it's a disease and I would never make light of or diminish that. HOWEVER my sympathies for him are severely limited and my willingness to accommodate him are nonexistent. 

My partner and I just got home from a weekend trip, I'm excused and was unloading the snack/drink stuff and left his bourbon on the kitchen table 1. Cuz it's super late and I wasn't thinking about it 2. The bar cart is full and I didn't feeling like rearranging it at 2am. My roommate and I were chatting for a bit and she looks at the bottle and the dialogue between us went:
Her: we need to move that
Me: (blank stare) he's an adult
Her: so are you
Me: fine. I'll move the alcohol in my home because someone who doesn't live here can't not drink something that doesn't belong to them
Her: it costs nothing to be nice
Me: (in an attempt to diffuse the situation in the tone of that stupid IG voice over thing) ya but how much does it cost to be mean? 

I ended up moving it and we kinda just ended it there and went to our separate rooms. I know what I said was petty but it pisses me off that she prioritizes him and rather than holding him accountable for his actions, ask me to care about her shitty ex. Whether the bottle was on the table or the cart wouldn't, and hasn't stopped him from drinking it before. If being in a house with alcohol in it is such a temptation then he shouldn't be here. It's not even about being nice, it's about burdening me, someone who does not like him, with the responsibility of managing/keeping an eye on him and his drinking. I have every right to refuse accommodating someone in my home regardless of whose guest they are. 

Ok, damn, sorry that was a rant but I need to know if I'm overreacting.

I work mostly from home as a Graphic Designer but I'm usually very busy and work all day, most days. I usually work from 6/7 am till 8/9 pm every day with breaks in between. He is a Restaurant Manager and Chef and usually works from 1 pm till 9:30 pm, 6 days a week. My bf complains that I don't clean enough and is upset if I ask him to help me with dishes or the floors.

His job is quite physical as he has to stand and actively make many food orders. Mine is sedentary and sometimes I do it laying down as well. After working all day, I still feel exhausted but agree that it might not match the level of exhaustion he faces at the end of his workday- so I don't ask him to clean very often. 

He doesn't cook at home, I do. When I cook, he doesn't want to wash dishes. The other day I planned and executed his birthday party.. Cleaned, decorated, cooked food for the guests, bought his birthday cake... played perfect hostess etc. The next day I asked him to wash the cups some of the guests used and he didn't want to. I asked him to wipe the floors, he didn't want to. He says that if he worked from home, doing the same job I did, the house would be spotless, and I don't do enough.

AITA for making a joke about my husband’s disability?,67,1573mgo,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1573mgo/aita_for_making_a_joke_about_my_husbands/,53,"A few months ago, my(27F) husband (28M) had to have his left leg amputated below the knee as a result of a car accident.  Things were understandably rough going for a while but he is doing well now and we have both been adapting.  My husband is sort of one of those people where nothing can fully derail his positivity, and this proved amazingly true for this situation.  He is the same person as ever, which happens to be a very goofy and humorous person (we both very much enjoy comedic things of all forms). 

 Also, I know this is an extremely strange and unlikely coincidence and I’m sure many people will not believe this post for this reason, but we also happen to be very big fans of the entire How To Train Your Dragon series (not just for kids I will fight you on that).  We have been for years. For those of you who may not know, the main character, Hiccup, of HTTYD is missing the lower half of his left leg.  I am only describing all this because it matters to the situation.

Two weeks ago we were both supposed to attend his cousin's wedding, but he was feeling sick so he decided not to go and I went alone.  I was sitting at a table with his parents and his siblings and their spouses.  These are people that I have known for a long time and generally get along with.  I hadn’t realized it until I was there, but neither me or my husband had seen much of them since the accident (we live far from them), so they were all inquiring about how he was doing.  I knew they were just worried about him and wanted to make sure he is okay.  

But in the course of telling them that he was doing fine, I let slip a vaguely untasteful joke. Not word for word, it was something along the lines of “besides, now our Hiccup and Astrid costumes will be great this Halloween”.  As I said, my husband and I enjoy our humor and I know that this is exactly the sort of thing he would find funny (I did tell him what I said later and he burst out laughing and was not offended).  

However, this comment did not go over well with the table.  My mother-in-law was especially upset, telling me that it's horrible to make jokes about his disability and that I should be more sensitive.  Sister-in-law starts on some long lecture about ableism (which, for the record, she is not an expert about).  And of course, by grand fate, he wasn’t there to assure them that what I said didn’t bother him.  I honestly had no idea what to say as I did not expect them to react so severely.  But I also stubbornly refused to apologize or try to ease things.

At first, I just thought I was in the right, but this exchange has been haunting me over the past two weeks as the family is still quite angry with me.  I think on some level I could have recognized that what I said could be perceived as inappropriate in that setting.  AITA for making this joke and upsetting the whole family?

My sister Lily (26) is planning a destination wedding soon. She got married on paper years ago and her wedding was canceled due to COVID. She wants to go through with it again this year and I was excited. I’m 17. When she first got married I was 12-13. 
 
I didn’t know it then, but she didn’t plan on inviting me or my twin brother to her wedding. She came over today to ask our mother to help her book the house everyone would stay at and find everything she needs for her wedding.  She was making a list of guests and I realized my twin and I were missing. I mentioned it to her and she ignored me at first.  My mom told her that we are old enough now and to let us come. 

My sister told her (and i quote) “This is my wedding. I decide who comes or not”. I was confused and that’s when my mom told me she wanted a no kids wedding. There’s, obviously, and huge age gap between us. Since we’re were in that category during her initial plan we weren’t invited. At first I wasn’t offended. But during her first plan my niece (12) and other children younger than me were allowed to go. That pissed me off. 

We argued for a while with her telling my mom she was welcome to stay home if she didn’t like it. That hurt my mom immensely since she’s sacrificed so much for us (she had to quit law school in her final semester). I told her that I didn’t care if I wasn’t invited and told my mom to go. My sister looked satisfied, but my mom asked me why I suddenly didn’t care. I simple told my sister that if and when u get married she wouldn’t be receiving an invite. She proceeded to cry and whine and call me unfair. 

My mom didn’t intervene and simply told us to rethink our decisions and to not ruin our relationship over something silly. I told them  I would reverse my decision if Lily simply invited me. And she refused and called me a “Bitter Bitch” before running out of the door. My mom told me she understood why I said that, but I was a bit rude. Her husband called me and told me I was “a spiteful devil” and I cause Lily to have a panic attack.  I feel bad that I caused her to have a panic attack but she was being unfair. AITA? Should I just let her have her way since it’s her wedding?

[UPDATE]

This will be the only update i make because frankly i don’t plan on dragging this out. they just left and i’m too tired to give proper text so bare with me. My sister apologized to me for what she did when i initially called her out. she did have a panic attack, not because she was mad that i went tit for tat, but the fact that her in laws pressures her not to invite me since they don’t like me. 

her husband blamed me after hearing about what happened but apologized realizing it was his parents doing. while apologizing means nothing to me i plan on allowing them to show me how bad they feel (from a distance) until i feel comfortable with them again. 

my BIL also mentioned how they plan on going low contact with his parent due to their constant harassment. my sister decided there’s no need for a wedding since they signed the papers or whatever and it would be a waste of money, and enough trouble has been caused. 

my parents gave them some nice choice words and have set heavy boundaries between BIL and i due to his inappropriate comments. my sister also told him it was unnecessary but if she actually cares is debatable. 

i brought up how she treated me and how outside influences aside that there was something else there and as i suspected i was right. she does hate my twin and i saying we’ve done nothing but breathe. however, she felt jealous since we lived the childhood she wished to have. she plans on going to my next therapy session with me and starting her own since she has her own problems.

AITA for making my daughter cry over a guilt trip?,6,157i67y,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157i67y/aita_for_making_my_daughter_cry_over_a_guilt_trip/,37,"Two days ago, I (53f) had a surgery to remove a skin cancer. The instructions were to keep the bandage on for 24 hrs and not lift ANYTHING for two weeks to a month, else I may bust my stitches.

I asked my kids for help around the house and they both said they were too busy. One (19f) going out of town and the other (23f) said she had a project to do, (she’s learning a new skill so she can get a better job.) I’m happy the one is getting to have some fun, and the other I’m proud she’s improving her life. But seriously, this sucks. I can’t afford hiring someone to help out.


So I asked a man on our second date to go grocery shopping, so I could feed the cat and get milk. Thank god, he was nice and didn’t mind my messy-ish house. 

(I didn’t realize I’d be incapacitated like this or I would have planned better.)

The next day when I changed my bandage, the wound was bigger than I expected and the ones that I bought were too small. I tried to use one, but it laid on top of my stitches. The pain was terrible, but I didn’t have anything else and it’s on my shoulder blade, so it’s incredibly difficult to get to.

I needed help. I contacted my friends but they were all busy. So I reached out to my daughter who said she was studying a new skill, and I explained that I was desperate for help. I couldn’t see my back, I didn’t sleep much because every time I rolled over, I woke from the pain. She said she could, but not until 10 or 11 pm that night, and she had another thing in an hour.

I called her, I thought I could pick her up quickly, run to the store, and get her back home for her thing. If she was late, I figured people would forgive her because she was helping her mom. She started crying because I was giving her a guilt trip and she needed to breath, exasperated I hung up.

I ended up going to the pharmacy, and the nice pharmacist helped and put it on my back… in the store, where anyone could see. It was weird asking a stranger and being exposed in public, but she was kind, and said I could come back again to put on the bandaid the next day.

Now I didn’t know it would be so easy. I did feel terrible that my daughter cried, and sent a text apology which she hasn’t responded to.

But I’m hurt. I don’t often ask for help. I ALWAYS bend over backwards, spend time and money (that I don’t have,) do whatever I can for my kids… but this hurt a lot because I really wanted her to help me verses a stranger.

I don’t know what to think and am going around and around in my head. 

I’ve never wanted to emotional manipulate my children, I don’t even point out my hardships or how I’ve sacrificed for them, but I LEGIT needed help, was alone, sleep deprived and in pain… also hungry… but that’s another story.

AITA? Is there something I’m not seeing? My parents were never divorced. Honestly, I don’t know what to think of this and would like to take responsibility for my part and make amends if needed.",1690127211.0
AITA for starting an argument with my husband over him doing shrooms on vacation?,213,156udm7,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156udm7/aita_for_starting_an_argument_with_my_husband/,352,"My husband (31m) and I (29f) got married a few months ago. 

Maybe pertinent info: we’ve been together for 3 years, known each other since childhood. In the last 3 years we have grown a successful business which serves children in an educational capacity. I also have children from a previous relationship that he is a very involved stepfather to. For our wedding, one of his old band mates gifted “us” a large bag of shrooms. I don’t use any substances, and he doesn’t either. He will have a beer once in a blue moon. We are pretty straight edge at this point in our lives and focused on our business and our family. He told me he had no plan to use them and would give them away to friends. He did give some to my adult nephew after the wedding who got horribly sick from them. 

Yesterday, my husband left for a weekend trip with his college buddies to the beach. No big deal. This morning he text me to check in, and I asked what his plan was for the day. He told me they were going to the beach, and he was going to do the shrooms. I was immediately pissed because 1. I feel like he intentionally failed to mention he was taking shrooms on the trip. We could have discussed it and come to some sort of agreement before he left, but he chose not to. 2. If he gets sick or arrested it could have serious consequences for him, our family, or our business.

To be clear, I know there are worse things than shrooms. I don’t particularly care if anyone does them, and I’m not against them for other people. I also realize he’s a grown man capable of making his own decisions. However, decisions are not without consequence that could impact other people. He has not done them since we’ve been together, and he knows I value transparency in our relationship. I feel like him not telling me until he had already driven across the state and was about to take them was intentionally deceptive. I’m also scared for his safety or if he gets caught with them being on a public beach. Even the fact that he was willing to drive across state with them seems reckless to me. I responded letting him know how I felt and told him I don’t want him to do them. It devolved into an argument via text. I decided to stop responding and we’d talk in person after his trip. 

I’m wondering if I’m making a bigger deal over this than necessary and was an asshole to freak out over it while he’s on vacation. 

TLDR: Husband didn’t tell me he planned to do shrooms on boys trip until he was already there and about to do them. I expressed my concerns and told him I didn’t want him to do them, which led to an argument via text. AITA?

Update: He text me a little bit ago to let me know he’s taking some soon and we talked briefly about it. He said it was a last minute decision as he was packing to leave, and he didn’t tell me when he was leaving because he was running late to get down there and didn’t have time to talk about it. We agreed to discuss that part more after he gets home. He also said they are doing them at the Airbnb they’re at and not the beach so they won’t be driving anywhere or in public which alleviates most of my concerns. He’s also only taking a small amount and not going after a big trip. 

Definitely feeling like I overreacted out of emotion earlier (mostly having it dropped on me out of nowhere), but I also feel a lot better now knowing he’s safe and being smart about it.",1690057690.0

Out of excitement I promised my dad I would send him some of my money from my paycheck so he didn’t have to buy gas so I did send it with hesitation bc it was cutting out what I perceive to be a big chunk of money I just got. And then he started saying that I should treat the whole family to Popeyes, we’re a family of 6 and my brother and dad will basically eat 5 pieces of chicken each with ease. And then my sisters started piggy backing and saying they wanted their own individual items apart from the family box and the total came up to over $110. I told them it was too much money and my eldest sister started getting on me saying that I’m the most selfish person she’s ever met and that I have no problem when it comes time for them to buy me stuff but I can’t get them lunch.

In my defense I had already allocated my money to several things even before I got my check and I know it sounds shallow but I’ve never actually gotten to just spend money on myself on things that I actually want I’ve never gotten my nails done so I wanted to do that, I wanted to go out and see a friend I haven’t seen in a while, and I wanted to do a lot of other stuff and now they expect me to spend basically half my paycheck on lunch for them.

We have busy work schedules and this was to celebrate her birthday. The movie ends 5:35 but we want to catch up. Laredos Grill nearby opens at 5pm. We enter with another family. There’s only us besides 4-5 servers we see standing by the entrance. I order a plate of fries and Ka gets a chicken fajita/rice, 2 drinks each. 20 minutes the family that came in with us leave so it’s just us 2 and the workers. 

Throughout this time servers keep asking us for anything else. 6:10-15 rolls around and there’s no relenting; so we realize they want us to leave. My fries and drink were $10.13 and K’s was $13.23. 

Like an adult I bought the Barbie tin and only had 13$ in cash after that. Another server comes back and hands me my 2$ and change but I don’t have anything else on me; so I just say they can keep it. Cue, “Really, Just $2 an change?” . Ka realizes faster than me during this but when she gets her card back she also gets an electronic ping from her bank that they didn’t just charge her 14$. It was now 23$. Then Ka hears them saying, “look here comes the two Ms. $2”

Ka knows I won’t stand for either I or my friends being harassed so she hurries me out. She tells me this later when at our homes they were shit talking us and why she rushed me outside before I could process it. Ka’s upset about being charged more but accepted the loss so long as I didn’t get hurt right there confronting all of them for both of us. She didn’t want to tell me but she didn’t want me going back anymore. 

I hesitated but finally call to ask why they did this and (skin-crawlingly) asked for their boss. When he gets on I only manage to get out, “Hey, I didn’t appreciate your servers being rude to my friend and I. If they have some issues; they shouldn’t take it out on customers. I tried my best-,” 
 I am then cut off to: “Oh, you’re the one of them that left a 2$ ‘tip’. We expect customers to pay them a percentage. So let just say you’re a POS and you should be told you’re a POS because there’s nothing wrong with the workers and you should learn how to give correct tips. I don’t want to hear anything else from someone like you and glad your friend had money to charge unlike you-“ more screaming I can’t hear because I’m like,” wow, you really tell people they’re a POS for 2$ and it’s okay for you to harass people?” he hangs up. I cried, I felt worse that: because I didn’t have more money, I caused my friend on her birthday to be charged double. I’m still a wreak over it.

AITA- for 2$ tip? For calling about the harassment? 

Tldr: I only have 2 dollars + change left to give as tip. So bff and I are mocked by servers on what’s suppose to celebrate her birthday and she’s charged 10$ extra because of me. Ending with derogatory yelling at me from manager when I ask why we were harassed over 2 dollars..",1690106588.0

I've mentioned it a few times but it's always been kind of shrugged off and considering it costs me like 30p per mile it doesn't seem much at the time.

This is like 4 years of driving her to work a couple of times a week, going shopping, dates nights etc.
One time whilst tidying I found a really old purse of hers and it had £5 inside and I thought to myself, you know what? I think I'm entitled to this. Next time I found an old gift card bought for both of us that still had £20 on it so I spent it.

We've gone probably 6 times in the last 12 months, and really enjoy it. We camp in tents and go to different campsites each time. The past six times I've brought both of my dogs with me, they love the outdoors and come on hikes with us etc. One of my other friends also has a dog, and he brings the dog with him as well. 

This morning we were preparing to go camping, and my friend (who we'll call Matt) texted me asking if I want a lift to the campsite, which is 6 hours away by drive. I said sure, since he has a 7-seater SUV with a lot of trunk space to fit all our gear. When he arrived, I loaded the car with our gear and then gestured to my dogs to get into the car. They hopped into the back seat and I got in the front. 

About 4 hours into the drive, one of the dogs began doing the whine he does when he needs out. I told Matt if he could pull over soon, since the dog needs to pee. He was annoyed and told me I should have made them go before hand (they did, but 4 hours is a decently long time). 

A little later, one of the dogs let one rip (I couldn't hear it but it smelled like dog fart), and I jokingly said aww, did one of you do a boom-boom? Matt was not amused. He basically told me that I was a snake for just inviting the dogs into his car and bringing them along. He told me that they were going to destroy his nice car and stink up the entire place. 

It never once dawned on me that he wouldn't have expected the dogs to be coming too. I always bring them camping, and he's always tolerated them. Yes, I've always driven them down myself, so maybe I should have communicated better. I explained this to Matt. He said I was completely inconsiderate. 

My worry is, if Matt is this concerned about the dogs now, imagine how he'll be during the camp if we drive anywhere. The dogs are clean now, and the only 'mess' in the car is the odd bit of hair, nothing major. If we go down to the river they may be wet etc which could frustrate him more. I also don't have my own car to take them in.

Usually my dad buys me tobacco but since I couldn’t bring any to Japan, I asked my nan to buy me some. She knows I smoke, and though she isn’t happy with it she understands why I do it, and is very supportive in helping me smoke less and not making me just go cold turkey. The problem is she doesn’t know any Japanese, so she asked my uncle to get it for me.

He hasn’t seen me since I was about 9, so seeing some little kid going into an almost adult smoker was a bit much, i get that. He refused, but I was going to stay there for two weeks and I didn’t want to go through withdrawals while there, since I just wanted to enjoy my time. I explained this, and gave him the money for it, still asking apologetically and nicely and he still refused. 

I gave up at this point, just telling my grandparents I had no luck but they got mad at him and told him that they didn’t want me to feel sick on holiday. Everyone’s acting weird, and my granda eventually went out and very awkwardly bought some baccy for me. Now every time I light a tab (in designated smoking areas and maybe twice a day) I get a whole rant about how I shouldn’t be smoking so young, and I shouldn’t have started smoking to deal with my stresses.
 I told him I couldn’t afford to just move to a different country so smoking was my next best option. Dick move I know- 

I feel like I’ve ruined the holiday, we just got back and  I’m probably never seeing him again for another ten years since we can’t afford to travel back and forth. 

(Tl;dr) AITA for asking my uncle to buy me cigarettes and making things awkward on a family holiday.

EDIT: though my family is unhappy with me smoking, my current family situation is a bit weird so here’s some extra context- when I was starting I was living with my mother, she was a big influence on me with the smoking and she was very abusive. When I moved out I was 15 and when my dad found out I was depressed he just gave me more nicotine because he ‘gets depressed when he’s not smoking too’. 
My mother is in no position to tell me what to do so she doesn’t even try, my grandparents mostly feel pity for me so they don’t say anything and my dad started smoking at my age too so he doesn’t see a problem with it.
I’m trying to quit, i know it’s illegal, I know I’m a fuck up, I know I put my uncle in a weird position. It’s just a difficult situation and that’s why I’m posting on here and not figuring it out for myself.",1690126584.0

If I surrender my room, I know I will have an awful work day (best I can describe it, I still get episodes of insomnia and it just sucks)

My parents will still have their room, my siblings' share a room and its... a crowded mess; which means only my room is viable for guests.

I (32F) am blessed to have a wonderful husband (33M) and a beautiful daughter (6 months). My husband's mother is a truly wonderful and lovely person, she is sweet and generous and welcomed me into her family with open arms. She absolutely dotes on our daughter, who is the first girl grandchild, and loves spending time with her. MIL is also very much into clothes and outfits in a way that I am definitely not and loves buying little girly outfits for her granddaughter. 

I love how much she loves our daughter and I think it's so sweet that she wants to buy her cute dresses and tops. My issue is that she buys so many lovely things (pretty much every week there are one or two new things) that I don't feel like I have the opportunity to buy things for my daughter because she doesn't need any more clothes. I buy the basics like vests and socks but never the adorable little tshirts. MIL has never bought her anything that I dislike or consider inappropriate/impractical, I'd just like to have a chance to pick some things myself. 

Part of me wants to explain this to her and ask her to slow down with buying things but I know she'd be devastated to think she'd upset me. She's so kind and she has a tendency (which she has told me herself in the past) to overstep a bit in her attempts to support her kids. If asked to, she always backs off immediately but you can tell that she's really upset with herself for not realising she was going too far. She's very, very careful to make sure she never does anything with our daughter that is against our wishes and checks about every little thing (even things that we think are inconsequential) to make sure she's following what we want as parents. 

I feel very mean and petty for being bothered and I'm very aware that MIL is doing us a huge favour by saving us a fair amount of money on clothes. I think my hormones are probably playing a bit of a role still in my emotional reaction because logically I know this is nothing. My husband doesn't mind it at all because he just wants our daughter to be dressed, he doesn't have any particular feelings about what she's wearing as long as she's comfortable. However, if I asked him to then he would support me in asking his mum to slow down a bit.

Prior to that, we had been acquainted as good friends for a couple of years. When my previous long-term housemate moved out, Housemate approached me about the possibility of moving in with me. We had been living together for about half-a-year, when Housemate asked if I would allow their long-distance boyfriend (Boyfriend) to move in with us from abroad. I agreed.

  
But, after Boyfriend moved in, things started to go wrong almost right away. Boyfriend spends most of his time in his room, sleeping or playing video games. When outside the confines of his room, he actively ignores me - even when we're occupying the same shared space. It's not uncommon for me to wish him a good morning whilst standing five feet apart in the kitchen, only for him to ignore me and push past coffee-in-hand.

  
Since I opened my home to him, he's never once shown an ounce of gratitude for it - or for anything really. Despite living completely rent-free, nothing is good enough. Even when there's nothing to complain about, he never offers a thank-you, or anything in the way of gratitude.

  
Since he isn’t working, I asked that Boyfriend contribute between an hour and two hours each day to chores; marginally more than what Housemate and I are already doing on top of our full time jobs. Initially this was agreed to, but now he complains about any chore you give him, or pulls out the old excuse of ""I'll get to it later""; Three days later and the shower is still a mess, or the kitchen sink is piled high with dishes - and I end up doing them myself. Since he’s moved in, the house is always a mess!  


I feel like the parent of some stroppy teen I can't control. This man lives in my house, eats my food, uses my utilities - never gives a word of thanks, or lifts a finger to help out, and is downright rude when approached. He contributes nothing and makes me feel unwelcome in my own home. I want him out.

  
I spoke with a mutual friend of mine and Housemate (Mutual Friend) about the situation, and told her my intentions. She told me I'd be an asshole if I went through with it, since both of us know that Housemate would lack the savings and income needed to financially support both Boyfriend and themselves while paying rent on a place of their own.

  
They told me that by giving them this ultimatum I'd be making Housemate choose between sending Boyfriend back to his home country, and homelessness.

  
While I was fairly certain that I was in the right, everything that Mutual Friend said to me is true. I know that whatever decision Housemate makes will likely result in Boyfriend ending up homeless.

  
As much as I don't want to see anyone end up on the streets, I still feel like I'm at my wits end here. So, Idk Reddit - WIBTA if I told my housemate that either his boyfriend goes, or they both do?

AITA for buying noise canceling earbuds to tune my wife out in the morning?,3925,1566rfb,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1566rfb/aita_for_buying_noise_canceling_earbuds_to_tune/,713,"I am 32 and male. My wife is 36. We have been married for five years now.

I work in a job where every morning I have different tools and items to prepare. On some days I'll be working at an office building, other days I'll be in a meeting, and occasionally I'll be working at someone's house. Each job requires different tools, each day requires different preparations to go smoothly. 

My wife has a very bad habit of following me around with miscellaneous items, chosen haphazardly, asking if I need them that day or not. She seems to think that she's helping me, but she only distracts me and has caused me to forget things I actually did need at times. The issue is she won't do it once or twice; she'll rapid-fire out ideas, and when I thank her but tell her I don't need any help, she just goes ""Yeah yeah yeah, but how about this?"" as she holds up a new item.

I've tried sitting her down and explaining to her that she's not helping me, but she keeps doing it. 

The low point came last week when she got really stuck on a carton of yogurt I had bought. She noticed the expiration date was coming up (in four days) and asked when I was going to eat it. I said later. Then she asked if I wanted it for lunch. I said yogurt that had been sitting in my hot car for hours wasn't an appetizing lunch idea, which encouraged her to start Googling how long yogurt can sit out for. This allowed me to get the rest of my belongings and head out.

As I pulled out of the driveway my wife came out the front door in her pajamas and started trying to chase me down on foot, shouting about the yogurt. I waved and left.

That was my breaking point. After work I went shopping and got myself a cheap pair of noise canceling earbuds. From the next morning, I put them in, played some white noise (I'm not a big music guy), and went about my business. My wife kept trying to get my attention by waving her hand in front of my face, as she held miscellaneous items, but it was a lot easier than normal. I've also found that sending her on a little mission to get something will help a lot and wish I had thought of it sooner.

Last night she sat me down and got really angry for ignoring her in the morning. I asked what I was supposed to do, to which she responded ""You're supposed to listen to your wife.""

I started back in 2020 and my boss  at the time was absolutely amazing. She was offered a busier store that would help her make a lot more money and sadly, ended up taking it. Of course, We were all curious to find out who the new store manager would be. We ended up finding out it was someone who used to work here a few months prior. 
   
  He 26 (m) made a lot of enemies at our store in the past. He was known for having attitude issues, getting into arguments, and being disrespectful. A lot of our staff was not happy about this at all. I had never met him before so I decided I would give him a chance before believing all the things people were saying. Within his first week he had gotten into multiple confrontations with different employees. Most of these employees had never once raised their voice or ever spoken out of line before to anyone. At least 3 employees ended up quitting just 2 weeks after he started. 

  He would come in an hour late to his shifts and just sit in the office while everybody else struggled to keep up with the business. If he wasn’t in the office he was standing behind you micro managing you’re every move. Despite all of this I still stayed open minded to the fact that he was new and had never run a store before. 

   A few months go by and I noticed he had been much nicer to me. He was scheduling me the hours I wanted and complimenting my work ( which NEVER happened). We were no longer butting heads and he seemed to have finally gotten the hang of his new position. This is when the flirting started. I being the oblivious person I am didn’t really notice he was flirting until 2 of my coworkers pointed it out to me. The flirting turned into sexual comments. I shut it down and told him that’s it’s not okay we work together and that he knows I have a boyfriend. He didn’t listen and kept making sexual advances on me constantly. I finally had enough and cussed him out calling him all sorts of names to make myself as clear as I possibly could. That finally worked and things were going okay for about a day until I noticed him all over the new hire. 

  They started following each other around, going out back together, being scheduled together, leaving in the same car, and just being too close to each other. Now normally I just mind my business but if you’re desperate for some action why don’t you just go on tinder? Why are you as a store manager going around trying to sleep with your employees?

I tell her I never asked her for all this, and to stop wasting money on food I never asked to eat. I tried to tell her I will cook and prepare my own meals but she doesnt allow it. Im so mad to be honest. Im mad that she feels like she has to work 2 jobs to afford expenses yet spend so much on me.  
  
Ive never really told her how I feel because I feel like it would be a soul crushing conversation to have, it already drives me insane for something that seems so small. She knows I do my best to save money, but it almost feels like she doesnt respect it for unintentionally spending so much on me as well.

So my wife and I have been together for about 7 years. I will fully admit that we are opposites on the things that we like. I love all types of sports, my wife is much more interested in science. It’s never been an issue for us as we both just kind of accept that the others thing doesn’t interest us, but we’ve made it work.

Now the issue. A couple weeks back I was invited to a party with my friends and their significant others. My friends, like me, are very into sports as are their significant others. So I planned on going, and told my wife that I had been invited to the event where we were going to be watching this sporting event, and it had a theme and such.

My wife then asked where her invitation was, and I told her that she would be miserable anyways. And like the last two parties we as a couple had been invited to, she requested to leave about halfway through because she wasn’t having fun. And on top of that, was complaining to people about how people overvalue sports and how they contribute nothing to modern society. People were obviously annoyed with this.

She got angry and said that even if she was going to have a bad time, it was extremely rude of my friends to not invite her. I then reminded her again of how she acted at previous parties, and said something along the lines of “maybe you would be invited if you weren’t complaining the entire time”.

Now I realize that is kind of a insensitive thing to say, but it’s true. She then retorted with that when I hang with her friends, I don’t contribute much to the conversation, and that her friends find it annoying I don’t speak with them on topics they enjoy.

Normally when we go I wrangle the kids and help them get their plates and everyone is eating by time I get to go to get my food. My husband goes up himself while I help the kids and each time brings back 2-3 fully loaded plates. Like small mountain loaded. 

I don’t care about how much he eats. It’s extremely understandable since he works construction. My problem is he finishes them fast and by time I get back with my first plate he’s done and heading back to the food area. After his second trip he’s usually done and sits awkwardly until I give up and say let’s go. 

So I barely get to eat and then I feel like we wasted money. Last time we went a few days ago and I asked him to just grab one plate at first so we could eat as a family. He complained and said I was trying to police him and his eating habits. He’s been petty since and making it seem like I was trying to put him on a diet or something.

They raised me with fear of them, I did anything wrong I got an insult or screamed at or generally just told how useless I was and how other kids were smarter than me, well you can imagine what this did to a kid’s mentality, any sense of self esteem I had was shredded, anytime I did speak to my parents, they seem happy with my sister’s methods without even knowing what they were cause of how compliant and obedient I was.

Fast forward a bit and nowadays I am an introvert, my idea of fun is to find a good novel and just spend the whole day reading but my siblings are the opposite, their idea of fun is to party, club and just going out, they are extreme extroverts which has caused a divide between us cause we have nothing to bond over. Me and one other sibling who is older than I am by 9 years live together and the house is tense to say the least, whenever my name is called my heart starts beating and I start having anxiety and my mind immediately goes through different scenarios of what I did wrong throughout the day that could get me yelled at(something I started doing as a kid) even if she’s not calling me to yell but simply to catch up. I am a young adult, I should be able to say something but the moment I am about to say anything about how I feel, this overwhelming feeling of fear just washes over me so I keep silent.

As you can imagine, this has led to a situation where I am considered the black sheep of the family, I am the introvert, the silent one in the house, the one that makes all the mistakes, the useless one and I think my sibling is finally tired of how different we are cause she says whenever she gets angry something along the lines of “I wish you were not my brother.” “I wish I had a smarter brother.” “I wish (..) was my brother, he would be more fun than you are, which honestly hurts cause imagine hearing someone who raised you wishes that they had someone else.

I told him you’re currently 5*6 and 140kg with balding hair and incomplete beard you look too ugly for tinder i suggest you start hitting the gym and get a hair transplantation also to shave his beard.

My wife was talking care of our newborn when our 3-year-old came up to ask her if she would help her go to the bathroom.  She said “go ask your father” because she was busy, so my daughter ran up to ask me.  We were sitting in a room with family (grandma, grandpa, aunt, uncle, brother, etc.), so when my daughter asked me to help her, I told her “ask your grandmother” who is constantly telling us she is happy to help and loves any chance to interact or help out with her grandkids.

Now my wife is upset because she said “I didn’t want some help, I wanted YOU to help.”  So please let me have if if IATA.

A couple clarifying points: if we were alone, I 100% would have (and typically do) helped my wife out.  This is not a disagreement about thinking diapers or whatever else is “wife’s work” or anything similar.  However, since I knew my mom would be very happy to help, I didn’t (and don’t) see the harm in letting her help out.

Also, I would have been 100% happy to help my wife out if I knew it was about “me helping” instead of getting her help when she was busy.  It literally didn’t occur to me for 1 second that asking for help would upset her.

In the future, I will be happy to help her myself even if it seems stupid to me because she’s my wife and that’s what a husband should do, but in this instance, our disagreement is about whether or not I should have known it would be upsetting to ask someone else to help instead of doing it myself.",1690066605.0
AITA for cremating my mentally ill mother against her wishes?,3,157i02w,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157i02w/aita_for_cremating_my_mentally_ill_mother_against/,8,"My mother was a paranoid schizophrenic but also highly intelligent. I grew up in her delusional world were everyone was involved in this government level plot to assassinate her. She had left my father and sister a year after she had me. She blamed my sister who was 9yo at the time for not coming with her. She was a dedicated and gentle mother, but also incapable of having normal emotions or relations. We lived as hermits.

When I was 16 I found my fathers adres and went there. That went south very quickly so after a year in a home for troubled teenagers I went to a squat and I have build my own life from there but things have been hard without help or parental guidance.

I would visit my mother once or twice a year, but she always tried to pull me into her delusions again. I would say my youth was horrible, she would reply it was fantastic and we would argue untill either of us was to angry to continue. Later I would visit with my wife and kids and she at least didn't try to brainwash them so that was nice.

When I divorced my first wife she chose sides against me. Although I was on my own and homeless as a result and my ex wife had the house and an enormous close knit family that supported her. I had to go to court three times to see my kids  and it was hell and sometimes I thought I wouldn't make it.

My mother never accepted my new partner and just kept my old wedding photo's of me and my ex on the wall behind were she would sit. She also denied the children from my sister from seeing her because my sister had ""betrayed"" her as a child (see first paragraph).

Because she lived on canned food, sugar and coffee her health declined further and she had to be taken to a care home.

She had been on welfare her whole life so I assumed she had zero money and the cost of a funeral would fall on me while I live paycheck to paycheck which freaked me out.

Come COVID and of course she refuses to vaccinate and dies. I drive 2,5 hours and the care home wants me to arrange the funeral because I'm the only close relative they know. I knew she wanted to be buried and turns out there's 10k in the bank! The care home wants me to decide quickly because she's lying there dead and it's still during COVID. I knew a proper burial with headstone can cost anywhere between 6K and 20K.

So I rang up the cheapest, fastest funeral home I could google and had her cremated a week a later. It's was a very nice and emotional ceremony, about twelve people even during COVID and everybody felt it was very respectful and fitting. I explicitly also invited my sister and her children and it felt good to be all together. The funeral was about 4K, I split the remainder between me and my sister and our children.

But lately I have been getting more mild about everything. She was mentally ill after all, and there was enough money for a modest burial. So am I the asshole for cremating her?",1690126817.0

I have two close friends that lived far away from the city, so once in a while when they come to the city either to hang out or for work, they have this expectation for me to invite them over to my house for a stay. Which, I kinda get it and I would do that if I could. 

The thing is that both my parents are unwell, and if I invite someone over they tend to go out of their way to be the best host possible even when I told them we don’t need to and I refuse to put their health at stake. Secondly, I have a lot of little nephews and nieces that come over most of the day and leaves a ton of mess (like any other kids) and I’m quite embarrassed to bring someone over because of that. Thirdly, my relationship with my siblings are not the greatest so if I were to invite them over, they’re going to notice the strain and I hate for them to know too much about this part of my family issue. 

I told all these stuff (very vaguely) to my friends in hopes that they’ll understand.

I'm thinking especially for my son who is the same age, as I only really have a couple of years before he will likely go off to University. My husband is going to talk to my step son and explain, he is going to plan a trip in the country with my step son which he gets to dictate (he can choose if it's just him and my husband or all of us, where we go etc.). I am doing this all guilt free - the comments which seems to assume I am just trying to exclude my step son or whatever are just wrong, I know that everyday I turn up for this kid, I have sacrificed so much and done as much as I can, and I can't keep pouring from an empty cup.****

Edit for clarification: I live in Europe. Also we now intend to talk to my step son about the holiday, and not keep it a secret. 


So I saw a similar post the other day and they got incredibly bashed! However the step mom sounded like she hated the kid. Which isn't the case here. 
Me and my husband are a blended family of 4 kids. His bio son who is a teenager, my bio son who is the same age and then two young children we have together.

We share contact of my step son with his mom. His son has Autism with ODD/PDA traits. He has a tendency to become verbally aggressive with us and the other children. He's in therapy and gets treatment, however we still have regularly outbursts and meltdowns, especially if things don't go his way/ he perceives someone else is getting their way/ he needs to share anything - even driving long distances are now avoided as they can trigger him.

We try really hard to accommodate his needs. Up until this point we have only ever holidayed domestically, as even the idea of trying to go on an abroad holiday is so daughting. Even our domestic holidays have been horrendous, always having to leave something early or actually be asked to leave by staff because his behaviour. For example we recently went to play ice hockey (his favourite thing) and he didn't putt his ball, he threw his stick and cursed at a member or staff. We had to leave and my son was really upset about it. 

I have actually taken my kids on holiday with family abroad once so they at least get that experience. Anyway, fast forward to now. I've received a nice amount of money for us and can afford to do a mini break abroad for 3 nights, with me, my husband and my son and our two little ones. Me and my husband chatted and decided not to take our step son because it will just mean 3 days away, walking on eggshells, and arguments. I wouldn't want to take the kids alone as the little ones can be hard work.

Instead I suggested to my husband to take his son away when we come back, just the two of them together. Or alternatively we all go to a caravan at the end of the summer holidays, whatever step son prefers. Our plan is to not tell my step son. 

My step sons mom has heard about this, and is very angry at me, and has basically branded me as an evil step mom, which is upsetting. But I honestly see no other way around this. Unless we just drag him along and the all kids have a miserable time? Or we just conceed and go on holiday domestically, but I feel my children are just missing out on the experience of abroad holidays and experiencing other cultures (and me too! I've only been abroad once!). 

My husband now wants to cancel and instead just do something domestic with them all. I feel deflated and stood my ground. But now I just feel like a massive AH.",1690014676.0

When my girlfriend and I got together a year ago, she made it clear that she didn't want to be a mother, whether to pets or children. She assured me that if I had any pets or children from before our relationship, she would be supportive and help out occasionally but assuming a motherly role should not be expected of her. No kids, but I do have two cats. 

She has largely stuck to her word, helping with various tasks like feeding, nail trims, playtime, and minor expenses, but she doesn't handle certain tasks like litter box cleaning or major vet expenses. I appreciate the areas that she helps in and I respect her boundaries.

She outright refused, explaining that she doesn't want the responsibility of caring for the cats while I'm away. I tried to find a compromise by suggesting she doesn't have to stay the entire time and can just visit daily, but she still declined and recommended that I hire a cat sitter. I'm taken aback by her response and unsure if my request was unreasonable? It’s not like cats are high maintenance. She doesn’t have to walk them everyday like if they were dogs. And the trip is very short— not even an entire week. When I asked if she had any plans that my request would be interfering with, she said no.

My GF asked me to pick us up some food on the way back and gave me her card to buy it. On the way back from my appointment, I stopped by a halal cart that was in the middle of this hub of street carts selling ice cream, hot dogs etc. 

When I order the guy tells me it’s $20, I was a little shocked it was so expensive but chalked it up to it being a touristy place, so of course they’re up charging. I pull out my card and he says it’s a $22 minimum, so I have to either pay in cash or buy $2 of something else. I knew he was bullshitting me to get more money, but I didn’t have enough cash to just buy it then and there so I begrudgingly agreed to buy a drink. 

I gave him the card and he brought it to the guy in the cart next to him and had him run it. I heard him tell the guy, “$25, put $25” So I walked up to him and asked why I was suddenly being charged $25? He said it was taxes and fees and something. I figured alright, $3 on $22 makes sense I guess and I let it go, but I was still sort of miffed by it all. As i’m leaving I’m calling my GF to vent to her about how ridiculously expensive the halal cart was and how they were so greedy for no reason. She checks her card and realizes they’ve charged us $29. They charged me $4 for who the fuck knows what.

At this point, I’m livid and I go back to the halal cart and ask the guy who made my food, “My order was $22 right? Why did you guys charge me $29?” He says he doesn’t handle the money and I have to talk to the guy who ran my card. So I do, and that guy says, “Well he told me to put $25!” I basically get into a heated argument with them bc they AGAIN try to play it off as “taxes”. I said, “$7 from a $22 order? That’s not fucking taxes.” The guy who made my food finally comes over to where we’re arguing and he goes “Oh the order was $23!” And then they start arguing bc the other guy said “You told me $25!” In the end, they gave me back $2.75, and said that was all they owed me. They owed me more than that, but at this point I was tired and people were staring at us.

Later on I was telling my friend about the situation and how it was such a scummy move. My friend told me I was “acting like a Karen”, and that it was only $4.

AITA for bringing my friend to a baseball game instead of my GF?,65,156wstl,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156wstl/aita_for_bringing_my_friend_to_a_baseball_game/,68,"I’m a huge baseball nut as are a few of my close friends. My gf and I have been together for about 2 years. I go to a lot of games and usually get cheaper seats. My gf and I have gone to games before but she doesn’t really care about baseball. She’s more into her beer and taking selfies all game and talking about random stuff. 

I was gifted 2 tickets to yesterdays game where the seats are 3 rows behind home plate right in the center. I’ve never had tickets this good before and I’m sure I won’t again in a long time. I was told we were on TV alot which was cool. 

Well i actually decided to bring my friend Max to the game instead of my gf. I mean these are great seats and a rare opportunity and I wanted to bring someone who actually enjoys baseball so we can actually talk about the game. Cut to GF not being happy. She was mad all week that I decided to offer the ticket to Max. Her reasoning is that she’s my *girlfriend* and should always come before friends for something like this. She says she feels hurt because it’s a unique experience with the awesome tickets and I’d rather not spend it with her. I tried to explain my reasoning to her and she won’t have any of it. She said it would have been an awesome date and instead I brought one of my boys. 

I know she’s still mad because I asked her to lunch today and she said “are you sure you don’t wanna bring max?” Than said she couldn’t go. Every time I try to say my side she just says *but I’m your girlfriend*  I tried to say we can go to a game soon but she says it’s not the same because it won’t feel special because  we won’t have the good seats. 

So was I an asshole for this?",1690063649.0

My brother got legally married to his spouse in March, just went to the courthouse. I have no issues with that. However, the two of them want a wedding also. Which isn't a particular problem for me either. They plan to have the event on August 11 this year (less than a month from now.) They did make the verbal announcement about it earlier this year (I think January) but only passed out any kind of invitation yesterday.
I was unemployeed for almost 6 months, (which he knew) and just started a new job last week. I cannot request PTO the day of their wedding. There is a chance I can switch shifts but that is a low chance and may cause issues especially being brand new at the job. There is also a chance my work will not schedule me during the wedding time.
[Retail job so who knows?]
I haven't yet discussed any of this with my brother or his spouse because neither of them respects boundaries the first time you bring up a topic and also I haven't seen them very often.
Also, last night my brother made the assumption I would be the wedding photographer even though 1) I have no wedding photographer experience 2) we had never discussed it 3) I would be just using my phone's camera
He did offer to pay but it was phrased like ""let us know how much you charge for wedding photos.""
Which puts the burden on me to research what would be a fair price to charge for it.

I will also add my brother and his spouse aren't particularly close to me and in particular, he has done some things to distance himself from our other two siblings for some reasons (long story) to the point, whenever he does come to my house, it's usually very awkward.",1690118298.0

WIBTA for not selling my extra concert tickets to my cousins?,2,157iegn,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157iegn/wibta_for_not_selling_my_extra_concert_tickets_to/,6,"\*Obligatory throwaway account warning\*

I (20F) am a huge swiftie. I also have autism which my mum has suggested is the reason I’m not fully grasping the issue.

For some context, my family is pretty firmly middle class, we are not struggling but we also don’t have any extra. My dad’s brother, though, makes very good money. Their family can afford luxuries such as multiple holidays throughout the year, the latest gadgets, etc. In essence, they have plenty of disposable income.

I‘m very aware of my family’s privilege but I hope my dilemma can be separated from it all so I can get some advice.

Anyway, I don’t have my own income. Whilst I would like to work, I also know that I would be a liability to anyone who hired me with how little I am able to handle external stimulus without having a breakdown. All of this to say, the only money I have is savings of birthday money accumulated over the past 10 years. Just enough for a special purchase.

I’ve never been to a concert before but Taylor Swift is one of my special interests and when she launched the Eras Tour, I decided if I was ever going to go to a concert, this would be it.

During presale, I managed to snag 3 standing tickets for my mum, sister and myself. I know these are not ideal for me, standing for 3.5 hours with no easy escape route should I become overwhelmed. I was still excited but decided to try getting better tickets through general sale. That way I could sell the standing tickets and maybe offset what I did spend.

I got better seats and decide to sell the others.

Here‘s where I might be the AH. Over the weekend my cousins hosted a dinner party at their house. I’m somewhat of a hermit and find loud settings with lots of smells very distressing. This dinner, I decided to attend since my great-uncle is very ill and this was to be something of a ‘last hurrah’.

I’m chatting with my aunt and cousin (14F) about Taylor as I do whenever someone shows engagement in one of my interests. The topic of tickets comes up and my aunt starts to lament what a scam they are and how the only affordable ones were standing which are no good because she’s so short. My cousin has tickets to go with her friend, but she’s worried she’ll be uninvited should she and her friend have a falling out.

My mum says that we have extra tickets and we can give those to her. I get really uncomfortable being put on the spot and say I’ll think about it. The conversation ends and I think that’s the end of it until today when my mum lets me know she’s going to sell my tickets to them and I have no say in the matter. I tell her I do since it’s my money and she says family always comes before money and if I don’t do this, I risk this tearing our family apart.

Am I being unreasonable? I’m more upset that my mum made promises on my behalf than anything else but also that my tickets would be sold to my aunt who turned her nose up at the original price for the same tickets and my cousin who already potentially has tickets.

My husband is a kind person, but unfortunately people in his life have not been the kindest to me in our time together. Since the beginning there has been multiple encounters that has left me feeling negatively.  The morning before seeing his friends, my husband tried to talk me down due to my anxiety about seeing them. I feel his friends look at me through a judgmental lens and will only see me that way. Most of my husband and his friends grew up in an upper middle-class neighborhood in the suburbs. They are all college educated and have had a very privileged life. Although I am college educated, I came from a poor, rural area. Their life experiences and mine are completely different.   
The most recent encounter has me wanting outside opinions. I truly do not understand what went wrong. However, these situations occur frequently with his friends. So frequently, my husband had to coach me all day before, and I took anti-anxiety medication before we left the house. My anxiety and depression have been a very tough battle for me. Most days I don’t want to speak to anyone, and social interactions terrify me. I’m always worried about saying the wrong thing. I also want to add, I am currently being professionally evaluated for an autism diagnosis. I have several spectrum-like qualities and identify as autistic. Social ques are not something I pick up on well. I also don’t understand hierarchy or social norms. I understand this puts me at a disadvantage often when socializing, but most people just find it to be quirky. Those are my issues and I’m trying to work through it.   
We went to see a movie as a group. After we got dinner at a Mexican restaurant. So, this Mexican restaurant was new. I knew this based on it being where this Mediterranean restaurant I ordered takeout decently often was. The question was asked, ""What was this restaurant called before?"" I said, ""I think it was called olive oil or something like that."" I said that based on the following information going through my head.  
1. I remembered it being two words.  
2. It was Mediterranean food.  
3. It had alliteration.  
4. It was quirky to me.   
  
Immediately they look at me and say, ""that's racist."" I'm super stunned and asked how. And the situation ended by my husband “shushing” his friends and myself. I feel like his friends were reaching. I just stayed quiet for a while after that. This situation has me hurt and it makes me want to go back into a life of seclusion. I am the type of person that believes everyone has a soul that is truly good. I believe people to act in negative ways based on personal bias, ego, misunderstanding, etc. I feel there is truly more depth to people and try to show the same grace to others as I would want shown to me. Everyone has a life journey to grow and be better versions of themselves. I refuse to judge anyone because I cannot grow and learn from others unless I understand their perspective.   
So, am I the asshole?

I also told them I didn’t want anyone else to know, especially my mother (I have my reasons). 

My older sister (30F) was the perfect one to tell. She was considerate, compassionate and appreciated the fact that I told her. My younger sister (26F) was the opposite. She yelled at me for telling her but somehow was also upset that I didn’t tell her right away? I explained that I didn’t think anyone was entitled to know, and that the only reason I told her now was to give her more autonomy in regards of her own health than I got. She said it was unfair that I didn’t allow her to discuss this with our mom. I told her she could ask me any questions she had, or talk to our other sister. She called me an selfish asshole and hung up on me.

We haven’t spoken since and it’s been 4 months. 

Anyway, I’m currently pregnant through egg donation. It’s truly a blessing and my boyfriend and I couldn’t be happier. He really want to tell our family about the pregnancy, but I would rather keep it to myself as I don’t feel like talking to my little sister just yet.

She's been looking after my kids since my youngest was born, 3 years ago. Around 2 years ago, she got two black Labrador puppies, and asked if she could bring them with her to babysit. I said yes, because I was in desperate need of a nanny and she was otherwise pretty good. 

Well, the other day I left something behind at home that I needed for work. I messaged the nanny and asked if she could drop it off, and she said she could. Well, I met her in the lobby of my office building, and she was there with the kids and her two dogs on their (very long) leashes. Dogs aren't allowed in the office but I was pretty stressed and relieved, so didn't say anything. That is, until I noticed one of the dogs sniff around at the couch and lift its leg and pee. The other dog then wandered over and lifted its leg on the couch in the same spot, almost as if it were trying to out-mark the other one. The nanny was too busy tending to the kids and didn't notice. She just held the lead without watching them as they wandered around. I didn't say anything because it would be a bit awkward. 

It's got me thinking though. We were there for probably 5 minutes tops, and both of the dogs engaged in marking behaviour. It makes me wonder, do they do the same behaviour at my house? 

So I texted the nanny, and basically said that I noticed both her dogs peed in the office lobby, and asked if that's normal for them, because I was concerned since my children play in the house. She told me that she's never seen them pee inside before, and that I'm probably overthinking things. 

Then this morning, she was running 5 minutes late so I waited outside for her to arrive. She got out of the car, and I noticed that as soon as she opened the trunk of her car and let the dogs out, they both ran up to one of my rose bushes and lifted their leg to pee, one after the other. Then they went to the fence and did the same thing, before coming back to her. 

I queried the babysitter, again, and asked if she was sure they didn't do that inside too. She got really annoyed and told me to stop being so insufferable. I said that it's really disrespectful to my clean home, and she told me to just go to work and stop micromanaging. I left it there because the last thing I want is to fight with the woman looking after my kids. 

AITA for making that accusation though? I feel as though the dogs have a strong marking and territorial tendency and it would probably have happened once or twice (or even everyday, who knows) in my home over these 2 years. ",1690126630.0

I told her that I had paid for my breakfast and it’s already fairly small so I can’t let her have some, otherwise it wouldn't be enough for me. She said she needed to eat something in the morning so she doesn’t “faint” during the walk to get her own food, which I completely don’t understand since she only needs to walk a few blocks to find food. I told her I’ll give her a chunk of my burrito if she is going to let me have a chunk of her food once she gets it. She called me petty and just walked out. And she had been giving me a passive-aggressive attitude since then.So Reddit, AITA?",1689978467.0

However, then my mate and I decided to play some pool (he has a pool table in the house). so I went to pick up a pool cue but my mate told me to wash my hands first. this turned in to an argument when I said I didn't want to wash my hands. 

I didn't think this was necessary as my hands were not very sticky as I had licked my fingers clean after I was done eating. My mate thought this was even WORSE as I had been licking my hands and said at one point ""wash your hands after licking them you're not a cat!"". 

It should be noted that my mate goes for a piss all the time without washing his hands and then touches my head (I'm bald). I'd rather have lemon cake on my head than nob juice.

AITA for trying to lose weight?,150,156nzrv,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156nzrv/aita_for_trying_to_lose_weight/,59,"I (30F) have noticed that I've gained about 10 pounds over the years and have been making small changes to try and lose weight. I'm getting older and realize my metabolism is probably slowing, so I want to start working on it before it gets worse. I don't consider myself to be overweight, but my personal preference is that I'm around 125 lbs. I'm 5'4"" and currently 138. again, I don't think I NEED to lose weight, but I want to. I would still be perfectly healthy at 125 lbs. 

The problem is my sister (37F) said that what I'm doing is triggering to her. She is a bit overweight and has really struggled with her body image for years. My heart breaks for her because I think she's beautiful and wish she could see that. But she thinks that me trying to lose a little weight is indirectly saying she needs to. To be clear, I have been making an effort to NOT talk about it around her because I know it's a sensitive topic. But because I got a Bowflex and have mentioned that I'm being mindful of calories, she said it's really triggering for her and it's hurtful. It's only come up in conversation because we want to meet for lunch and I said I want to go on my cheat day, and another time I mentioned that my husband and I are trying to eat healthier to get in better shape. But my sister hasn't had good experiences in the past with calorie counting and believes that it's toxic. I recognize that may be the case for some people, but for me I feel fine doing it and find that it's helpful.

My sister says she's worried about me and doesn't think I should lose a single pound. I don't think it's fair to me, because I feel like this is a personal choice that is nobody else's business. I'm still eating 3 meals a day, I'm not starving myself, and I'm not hurting anyone else. I'm basically just not eating snacks, junk food/candy, drinking soda, and I'm keeping my meals all around 400-500 calories. But even if I don't ever bring up the topic, my sister says just by me doing what I'm doing, I'm triggering her. 

AITA?

UPDATE:

I talked to my sister and explained that my choices are my own and I have a right to do what I think is best for me. I told her that I can respect her boundary by not talking about it around her, and she needs to respect me by trusting that I know what I'm doing and I'm doing what's best for me. I also told her that my choices have nothing to do with her and that her feeling hurt or insecure is the last thing I want. I said that making these changes in my life by no means is making any comment about her body. I told her I love her and think she's beautiful regardless, and I just want her to be happy. 

She apologized and recognized that I didn't do anything wrong and that it's just her own deep rooted issues with her body that she needs to work on. To those saying she's narcissistic, I disagree. She's never been that way towards me. She's only human and has her own insecurities just like anyone else. None of us are perfect humans all the time. I love her dearly and it breaks my heart that she's in pain and struggling so much. 

Lastly I just want to mention that this wasn't a post to bash on my sister, so I don't appreciate the fat phobic comments that have been coming in here and there. I appreciate the support but saying cruel things is unnecessary and not the point of this post. 

Thank you for all the great advice. I have been reading all the comments and they are so appreciated!",1690041949.0

"AITA for declining to participate in a ""meal train"" for a woman with an able bodied husband and adult son living with her?",18163,155ud52,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155ud52/aita_for_declining_to_participate_in_a_meal_train/,4567,"\*I DO NOT GIVE PERMISSION FOR THIS POST TO BE SHARED OUTSIDE OF REDDIT \*  So some ladies in our church occasionally send out invites for ""meal trains"" for people to sign up to bring meals for someone who recently had a baby or is sick or something like that. I get it. It's a nice idea to help people out. I have no problem and have participated sometimes in the past.

Last week a meal train was posted for a lady named ""Sue"" (name changed obviously) who apparently had spent a few days in the hospital due to severe back pain. She's home now but still in pain and unable to do much. The meal signup stated about bringing a meal for 3 people. Sue lives with her husband and adult son. The husband and son work full time. Sue does not work.

I decided not to sign up for this meal train because I also work full time. I figured if people want to, that's fine, but I don't have extra time to be cooking meals for people who have capable adults in the household to help out. Some people do have extra time, and that's great if they want to help out. Well, I'm guessing others felt this way too because the meal train just wasn't filling up very fast so they kept posting about it and posting about it. I kept ignoring it.

Last night I got a call from a friend of Sue's. We'll call her Jane. Jane asked if I was aware that Sue had been in the hospital and if I could possibly sign up for a meal slot. I explained very nicely to Jane that I work full time and I don't often have time to make a full meal and that my husband and I usually just get our own meals or one of us cooks when we're able. She was like, ""Oh well that's ok. There are plenty of weekend slots availble too that you could sign up for when you're not working."" I said, ""Well, aren't her husband and son home on the weekends? Couldn't they cook then?"" Jane got really snippy with me then and cut the conversation short. I told my husband about it and he thinks that I could have made time on the weekend to cook something and take it over just to be nice. I asked him why didn't he sign up then if he thought the needed meals on the weekend and he told me I was just trying to start an argument.

I don't think I'm the AH because Sue's husband and grown son should be perfectly capable of cooking for Sue and themselves, especially on the weekend. But I might be the AH because I don't have much going on during the weekends and I COULD cook for them. I just don't see the need to.

AITA For throwing out my Mum's belongings?,8,15783qj,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15783qj/aita_for_throwing_out_my_mums_belongings/,17,"Hi AITA, long time lurker first time poster,

I (M25) have a mother (F44) who is hoarder, plain and simple. 
She's a drama teacher who has always been heavily invested in theatre, and as a result, consistently acquires costumes, props, set items and teaching resources. Whether via shows she's done, or Facebook posts where she thinks ""oooh that might come in handy""

This has been ongoing since I was about 3, when my parents split up. 
For context, she already has a standard 40 foot shipping container, and 125m^3 storage locker in a storage complex about 15min drive out of our small town, both of these are full of stuff. 

Over the years, our family have slightly taken advantage, and probably 5-10% of her stored belongings, are heirlooms, old furniture etc, stuff no-one wants, but don't necessarily want to get rid of. 

About 5 years ago, my mother got a job working at a school on the other end of the country (we live in New Zealand in the north island, this job was in the south Island) approximately 1110kms away. 

However, when the job ended, she moved back north, and filled a 20ft container, and left it with my grandfather at the bottom of the north island (still about 450km away). 
Her total storage costs approx $400 per fortnight.

Cut to a year ago, my grandfather has been burning bridges with our entire family, and so mum wanted to get her stuff closer to home, so as to not worry that my grandfather would hold it ransom, so I proposed a solution. 

In June 2022, I offered for her 20ft container to be moved onto my front yard, with the stipulation that it would be gone by July of this year. She agreed, and the truck arrived as planned. 

Mum lives alone, and earlier this year, I helped her move house, into a much larger house, from a two bedroom with single garage, to a three bedroom and double garage. She assured me, that this would help her be able to empty her rented storage, saving her money, and reducing her stress. 

This evening, she called me and asked that I give some leniency because her garage is full, but she could shuffle some things in her other storage to make room for what is left in the container. 

I politely told her, that I understand her situation, but I've been clear, and the first trailer load she took, was 6 months after the container first arrived at my house. The deadline will not change, and the container will be gone by the end of the month. 

She told me talking to me now makes her feel like shit, and hung up on me. 

She's been told I will donate, or otherwise remove what is left, at the deadline, and genuinely, I've been respectful and kind about this situation for years now, and told her she needs some hard love to get rid of some stuff at this point. 

So Reddit, AITA?

TLDR: Made a deal with mum to look after her storage container for set timeframe, now deadline is close, she wants an extension.",1690097126.0
AITA for leaving my bf 's birthday party?,5,157asa1,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157asa1/aita_for_leaving_my_bf_s_birthday_party/,12,"
I (23F) have been with my bf(24M) for over a year now. We live together and know each other pretty damn well. 
For the past few months I have been struggling with how I look. I am very tall (178cm) and have som body fat. Current weight around 80 kg. But I work out. I started to lift weights and I love how much muscle I am getting. But still am very self conscious.  I have been listening to how big I am since I was 12-13 y.o. from my family. And it left a mark. My bf knows about all of this. I also suffer from social anxiety to the point I get nauseous.  He knows about this too. And if that wasn't enough I am also on the spectrum. 

Now to the story. I celebrated his last birthday with him and his friends too and it was okay so I thought this year would be no different.  The ""party"" took place in a forest, friends brought their tents and stuff. My bf was not feeling well past few days so we made a deal that we would sleep in his parents house nearby. He told me the party could go well into the morning hours, I said okey.  First couple of friends came around 4 PM and I enjoyed myself. Didn't drink much, just to get the anxiety to calm. Somehow we were talking about clothing we like to wear and my bf starts talking how he likes bigger shirts and stuff and then looked at me and said that that's why he is with me (as he likes bigger stuff) I was cought off guard completely.  When I got him a bit away from his friends to silently confront him he said something in the lines that i am being too much. I was flabbergasted.  After he saw how much I was hurt he started frantically apologising. 

I sat back to my place and didn't talk much, didn't drink anymore, and just was completely alone for the evening. My anxiety got to the point I wanted to barf. Around 11PM I just got up and left without anyone noticing (I didn't want to make a scene) and just texted my Bf that I left. I slept in a different room. Today we are barely talking to each other. 
(Just a note,  this was his second party, he celebrated with his family a week ago and it was very nice)

I simply stood there watching them. After a great deal and a few vids and photos for evidence I barged in and asked wtf was going on. He said our relationship was not official so it would be fine. I stated that we were and are still exclusives. No response from him. So I left that house....

During covid I didn't really have steady work, but ever since I got a job I've paid my mom a monthly ""rent"" of a few hundred dollars. This year she asked for more money because she's struggling to pay for heat while on a fixed income, so I'm paying her $400 now (way lower than the average rent in my area), and sometimes give extra to help pay for repairs on the house.

  
Last week, she told me she needed money earlier in the month because she's struggling to make credit card bills. I was upset because I try to budget out my expenses consistently every week to make other payments (car loan, family phone bill, etc.), but I still paid her earlier, and also gave an extra $400 to cover half the cost of new windows we were getting.  


  
4 days after the credit card conversation, I came home from work and she told me to go try on the new pants she bought me. It turns out she got me a bunch of clothes that I didn't ask for or need, totaling about $300. When I asked how could she afford to spend so much on clothes if she couldn't afford to pay her credit cards off, her only response was to say that I needed new clothes for work (I don't), and that I was only mad because I wanted to keep all my money instead of helping her.  


  
I kept trying to explain my feelings, but that made things worse. She went from ignoring me to telling me to try the clothes on (I even tried to ""compromise"" where I'd keep some of the clothes and she'd send the rest back, but that went nowhere). Eventually she told me to shut up and asked when I'd be a real man, and I said something along the lines of ""you have no friends because you're so selfish and manipulative."" It was mean and I shouldn't have said that, but the ""be a real man"" stuff always triggers me and at that point I was really frustrated with her. I have since apologized for what I said, but when I ask for an apology she just ignores me.

  
I feel ungrateful because she spent the money on me, but I didn't need or ask for new clothes. I'm an only child and most of her family lives in another state, so I think sometimes she focuses on doing things for me in a way that's more for her than for me. I understand it's her money once I give it to her, and I'm still paying way less than I would if I moved out, but I can't help but feel my trust has been broken. She asked for more help this year because she ""didn't have any money,"" and part of the reason I stay at home is because I'm genuinely worried about what would happen to her if I moved.

  
I do want to support her after everything she's done for me, but it feels like if she can drop $300 on clothes for ME, she doesn't need my help, and I could have been saving money to get my own place.

To start the day off we all accidentally got split up because the line to get in was chaos. Me, willow (16 F) and my other friend Mellisa (16 F) got in the park 40 minutes before Lisa and cassie (17 F) did. Me, willow and Mellisa tried to wait for them but security guards pushed us away and told us we couldn’t wait by the entrance. So we tried messaging and calling lisa and Cassie but neither responded so we made a bad choice and just went to the first ride. After an hour of waiting in line we see lisa and Cassie enter the line right at the beginning. Lisa starts screaming at us and spam messaging and calling us. We try to explain to her what happened but she is still pissed. We tell her we will wait for them after the ride but we can’t go back because that will just annoy everyone in the line. Cassie then messages me saying that was a good idea and Lisa is making this into something it doesn’t need to be. 

After that ride we decide to go for lunch and a toilet break. When we are lining up for our next ride I notice that my phone is missing and I realise I left it in the toilet. I instantly panic and tell my friends. I say I’m going to go get my phone and I will wait for them after the ride. Lisa offers to come with me. Remember this, I did not tell her to come with me I was perfectly fine with going by myself. I say ok and we head back to the toilets. When we check the toilets I see that my phone is no longer there so we start heading to customer services. On the way to customer services lisa stops and phones her mom. I tell her to stop because that’s a useless thing to do because how will her mom help us when she is miles away?! Lisa gets mad and shouts “who even loses their phone!! You’ve ruined my day!!” I was now angry, stressed and upset so I tell her that I never said she had to come with me and I was fine with going myself. I keep heading towards customer services and at this point I’m crying. Lisa is still on call with her mum when willow decides to call her because we were taking ages and they had left the line. Lisa then screams down the phone at willow to stop calling and that willow is making everything stressful even though how was willow meant to know that she was on a useless call to her mum. (Later I was told that Cassie started crying because of the way lisa was shouting at willow). After we finally get my phone from customer services lisa turns to me and I kid you not says “aren’t I the best friend in the world for helping you get your phone back” exhausted I just say ok and hug her.

When  I ask them why she is not invited they come up with silly excuses like: ah we do not have enough seats in the car(we're travelling by airplane but we have multiple cars to drive to the airport and we all have licences), no we only want to go with the 5 of us your sisters boyfriend is also not invited (they're together for 2 months now). So my girlfriend stated she does not want me to go with them, because she thinks my parents behaviour is unacceptable. Wich agian I do understand, her parents invited me to come along with their vacarion. She feels like I should stay with her. 

However I do not agree with not going. Iam really looking forward to going to NY with my parents because it's been 2 years since our last vacation. I told her she shouldn't be so jealous, if her parents only invited her I wouldn't be irritated at all and would wish her a great time.

I was never given a reason other than my room and desk area weren't clean after I was given a week notice to clean it.  
  
At the time I worked part-time and now I'm full-time. I'm tired and sore when I get home and don't have the energy to clean. My room wasn't messy, nor was my desk area. I had room to get to my bed in my room and my things around my desk were organized.  
  
After the week was up I was immediately given notice that I had to be out by the end of the month and that I was to have my things packed by then. I spent the next few weeks working and looking for a place to live. I found a couple of apartments that I can afford but they didn't have any open units so I had to keep looking. On the very last day I found a room to rent in a house. The room was a little bigger than the room I had with my now former roommate.  
  
She told me that now that I'd found a place I had to be out by midnight with my things. At this point I had only packed three boxes of valuables but couldn't take them with me that night as she refused to drive me.  
  
When I came back the next day because I was expecting a package, a new phone because she refused to let me keep the phone I had as it was on her account, and she refused to let me stay while she took her mom to an appointment. She told me I had five minutes to grab my things and to get out. We set up days where I could go over and pack the rest of my things but things came up and made it where I was unable to go. She ended up packing my things and stole from me!  
  
When the day came for me to pick up my things she already had them placed outside. It took me a few hours to get everything into the uhaul and then she refused to let me get my cats! She claims that they're hers because she's paid for all the food, vet visits, and pet insurance but I have papers from before I moved in stating that they're mine! I called the cops but they refused to do anything stating it was a civil matter. I left and posted online about it on a few social media sites and called her out using her name and her address. She made a post replying to it and when I commented on it calling her out again she deleted it and blocked me. She also blocked my number after I left a message asking where the rest of my things are. She tried to keep my bike and a few other items but claims she didn't.  
  
A few weeks later I went back to try to get my stuff and she called the cops on me to have them escort me off the property. I managed to get my bike, she claims that I left it in the closet when I got the last of my boxes out of the room. She later filed a police report stating that I've been harassing her when I'll I've been doing is calling her out on her bullshit.  
  
I'm still trying to get my cats back but I haven't had any luck yet. I'm even trying to buy documents stating that the cats are my emotional support cats but it's expensive. I just want my babies back. AITA for calling her out?",1690114763.0

He said ""Oh, I thought he was your grandfather"", and I was offended at that, but I didn't say anything. But he appeared to mull over it and then said ""And your mother's comparatively younger?""

I asked him why it was any of his business and he said ""Nothing, it's just a little weird."" But I could see that he was implying something and asked him exactly what he meant by that. He hesitated and then said ""It's kind of creepy."" I knew where he was headed with this, and under my glance he said it's kind of disturbing that my dad was older but had married a much younger woman.

I lost my temper then, and said it's none of his f\*\*\*\*\*\* business how old they are, and that it wouldn't be nice for him if he talked about my dad like that. He looked shocked at it, and then said it was just his opinion anyway. I told him I don't need his opinion and to get out of my sight.

The end result is that he looked seriously upset and also said I'm overreacting at something that was just his opinion, and now I'm wondering whether I did overreact.

I make around $140k a year working as a QA manager and he makes $40-50k working as a warehouse forklift driver. He’s never been into working and we talked about him SAHD and I initially agreed because childcare is expensive (we want at least 2 kids). 

7 month ago he lost his job when there was a push for unionization and some people were essentially bullied out. He was without a job and I agreed to cover living expenses fully if he does the housework, cooks, etc. Before I didn’t really think of his ability as a SAHD. In the 7 months I come home to empty beer bottles, trash on the coffee table the fridge is constantly empty because he was suppose to go buy groceries but never does. And when he does it’s mostly junk food. We originally agreed he would cook and he has cooked maybe 4 meals for me. I’m still doing most of the cooking and cleaning. Now I just can’t imagine him as a stay at home dad. He just sleeps in and barely applies for jobs. He just got one but that’s finally in response to me putting my foot down that I’m no longer supporting him. My mom was a SAHM and with 4 kids she still kept a spotless house and cooked every meal from scratch. 

We’ve been fighting about this a lot recently and I have told him if we do have kids he has to work because he isn’t contributing at all now and so I can’t imagine he will do anything as a SAHD. He yelled that he has to apply for jobs and he’s under a lot of stress. But what’s the stress? He has everything taken care of and he barely applies to 1-2 jobs a day. He didn’t do anything we agreed upon what me taking care of finances and I don’t know how to move forward with the relationship. But AITA for no longer wanting him to be a SAHD now that I see what he’s been like the last 7 months?

Edit: thanks for all the comments. I’ve decided to end the relationship and will tell him this afternoon. This made me realize how resentful and unhappy I am with him and that is unlikely to change. To those who say he probably has depression, he may he has never communicated it but yes it could be the reason. But even if he does I doubt just by knowing it will fix my resentment. So it’s best we end on semi friendly terms.",1689970763.0

My husband is a mechanic. 

I am HOPELESS when it comes to anything mechanical. I have no sense of direction and struggle with spacial concepts.

I am good with words. I guess I’m a typical clumsy vague nerd lol

My son is just like me.

I often ask my husband questions about my car.  Sometimes these are on behalf of my son - and other times they’re for me. 

Questions like “what pressure should my tyres be?”, “do I need to do anything different when driving in the snow?”, “where is the tyre placard?”, “what does this warning mean?”.

He doesn’t like me or my son asking these questions. He says we are driving a lethal weapon and should have read the manual back to front.

It makes him really angry when me or my son drive with tyres that are low in air, or don’t check the oil often enough. It makes him angry if my son has broken brake lights and doesn’t fix them for weeks/months.

My son should fix them - but my husband and I have a deal that because of his expertise he maintains the cars (his, mine, the cars) and I pay for them (cars themselves, fuel, rego, insurance, repairs). No one has taught my son how to maintain a car. My husband expects him to just watch YouTube to learn how or read the manual.

My son in studying medicine, works in retail, volunteers and has a girlfriend. It’s not an excuse but he’s busy (and absent minded like me) and he’s probably forgotten to deal with this. To be fair, he has been on Uni holidays for the last month.

It upsets me that my husband is so angry and spiteful. I probably should know these things by my ripe old age but I don’t.  I want him to HELP me and my son. I want him to be kind and gentle and teach us.

I think I might be TA because I find it difficult to remember to check these things and remember how to fix them.",1690024004.0
AITA for telling my wife to pay for her half of living expenses,61,156t47k,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156t47k/aita_for_telling_my_wife_to_pay_for_her_half_of/,64,"I (35M) work in a HCOL place and have been married almost a year to my wife (31F) who comes from a LCOL place.

My wife graduated from college with a degree but when she couldn't make ends meet living with roommates a few years after college, she moved back home. Her amazing parents lovingly welcomed her back home and she didn't have to pay rent. This allowed her to be very laissez-faire towards work and financial independence. She's a sweet and lovely person but has admitted to me she's a poor self-driver.

I let her know she doesn't have to worry about living expenses when we get married so she can figure out a career and settle in. 5 months later she decides real estate. Awesome! She decides to take an online course so she can go at her own pace while she works part-time at a job.  I'm not keen on it since it takes weekends away from us spending time and maybe her study time. She tells me she wants to be aggressive with the real-estate thing and aims to finish in 3 months. Most people take a class and finish in 3 months.

A month in, she's done a little less than half of part 1/3 (12/28 chapters). Okay so her pace is no longer 3 months but looking closer to 6-7 months. I ask her if her not working would help her move a bit faster and she said no.

2 months in, she's done 21/28 chapters. Okay so her pace is about 9 months now. I'm pretty annoyed since during this time she starts to play Stardew Valley and sinks hours into it along with Netflix & IG. She tells me to just trust her.

Nearly 3 months in, she tells me she's almost done with part 1. I think it's like 24 out of 28. It's slow and we've both agreed that she would quit her part-time job after month 4.

It's 3 weeks into the 4th month and she still hasn't finished part 1. Her pace is now about 12 months. She finally admits that work was getting in the way of her working faster.

I'm livid because she says she's going as fast as she can and to just trust her. When I work from home, she starts eating breakfast I made for her at 10:30 and maybe starts studying at 11 and by 4 she's playing games. She tells me to treat her like an adult and trust her to set her own schedule. I just ask how her pace is every month and get annoyed with the slower and slower pace. I get told I'm betraying her trust for doing that.

Last night I was at my wit's end. Adults are financially independent and responsible for themselves, right? It's not like we have kids and she's the SAH mom so I have to be the breadwinner. Married couples in this area all split the bills.

I tell her maybe she should just pay for half of everything. I'll leave her alone with real estate and she can go at whatever pace she wants to. I don't want to foot the bill of living in a HCOL place alone forever. We can move to a LCOL place like Dallas but she said no.

I know I can be a bit pushy and harsh with myself and others but on the other hand I feel like she doesn't appreciate the freedom I gave her.

Our relationship has had many ups and downs, especially when it comes to money. At the beginning of our relationship we seperated our finances. When we decided to move in together, a short time later my finances became the main source of income for the household. He's a freelance artist and work had become very slow. It wasn't discussed, just kind of assumed that I would cover everything, our bills needed to be paid and obviously food to eat. This has become the norm. 

He spends like crazy! I try to save but it's always some very important thing that needs to be paid or purchased. It's usually not very important. I know, I need to be more direct on this issue but, from the past few occasions I attempted to have a conversation about our finances and it turns into a big argument that drags on for days! To the point he sulks in our room for a minimum of 3 days. I'd work up how to phrase the discussion so he isn't so..... offended (I guess that would be the term). But, still as expected the 3 day argument would occur. This is the outcome with anything to do with money, even when Id loan money to family. They always paid back.

I went out with a cousin to the casino for her birthday few days ago. I ended up winning 3000 and I gave my aunt 300. She's like my mom, I help her when I could. When I got home I didn't want to go through the whole argument and sulking phase for days to come on why I'd give my aunt 300, so I lied and said I won 2700. So, I wouldn't have to explain I gave my aunt 300 just because. 
Well, today he found out how much I actually won. Small town and his friend just happened to be there and witnessed my win. I admitted I did win that amount, apologized, and explained my reasoning. But he's upset I lied. I understand, if the roles were reversed I wouldn't appreciate it but I'd really try to understand why they'd lie about money. What about my behavior makes them, my person feel so compelled to lie than tell me honestly. So, am I the asshole for lying about the amount, and amount given?",1690096357.0

Including my brother and his fiancé.

For 5 years my brother has been with his girlfriend/mother of his child/fiancé. She has always been back and forth if she wants a relationship with me. For years we’ve been on good term/bad term (all on her timing)

From new years till now I’ve seen my brother a handful of times. I have so sneak around to see my niece at my moms house. We (my brother/mom and I) have to deal with the aftermath of seeing her every time. Therefore is been less and less  as the time goes by. My SIL has done multiple shady things but never has told me straight forward why she doesn’t want a normal relationship with me. 

Last thing that blew me was my niece’s bday. My SIL sent out the invites at the end of May beginning of June. My brother called and asked if he invited our dad, if my dad could at my house as SIL had her family at their house. I said fine but was feeling some type of way because I never received a formal invite. He shortly after the call sent it to me. Mind you at this point we were 10 days out from the bday. She blame him and he took full responsibility for not sending me the invite. 

Closer to the day I called my brother, asked him not to bring my dad as I was working and wouldn’t be able to attend to him. He agreed it wouldn’t be the best choice. I later found out my SIL stated my dad would be ruining her plans for the week ahead with her fam. I was upset but let it slide. I did not go to the party as it was a weekday and SIL said all people that were meant to be there had requested the time off to attend the party. I had just started a new job a couple of days before receiving the half invite. So it was to short notice to request time off. 

As of yesterday my mom and I argued because I said I wasn’t pressuring my daughter to invite her uncle/my brother because he will be with his narcissistic fiancé and I was trying to avoid any more issues. This was after hearing my brother tell my mom my SIL wants to be present every time my brother and I get together. As he is not allowed to hang out with me without her. My mother cried saying I would regret this decision and my daughter would too.

So as most of us 
 know, the two movies Oppenheimer and Barbie have started showing in cinemas and me (f16) and my best friend (f16), made plans to watch both movies. 

Some backstory, i’ve not recently been hanging out with my friend that much as we both have some issues going on family wise and therefore don’t have time or effort to hang out as much as we used to. It’s also important to know that my friend is autistic and therefore can get overwhelmed when she’s with more than two people, so i’m there to do what i can to make her comfortable. The fact i was able to watch a movie with just her was very exciting and we enjoyed it a lot. 

This morning we had planned to watch the Barbie movie and since she’s friends with my cousin (m16), we both decided he can come along as he also wanted to watch it. Me and my cousin are very close and have been through a lot of stuff together as we both grew up in a toxic household, so we’ve always been there for each other no matter what. I am also very happy that they get along. After we decide what’s happening, a few hours go by and my cousin asks us if he can bring his friend. I say no as i had told him earlier that this was just for us three, and he’s also aware that my friend gets uncomfortable with people she doesn’t know. After a little hissy fit about how he “doesn’t want to be the only guy there because it makes him look gay”, he agrees. 

Not even an hour later he tells us that 4 of his friends want to go and he’s already told them the plans. I become very angry and private message him saying how rude and inconsiderate he is, to which he argues back and says again how he doesn’t want to be the only guy when he goes see the barbie movie with two girls? my friend gets a little upset by this and i decide that i’d go with her at an earlier time to watch the movie, and not tell my cousin to avoid him showing up anyways (which he’s done before) The next day, my friend and i go out for dinner, watch the movie and come home and decide to have a sleep over. 8 o’clock rolls by and i get a bunch of angry messages from my cousin saying how selfish and horrible i am. Turns out he showed up with not 4, but 6 other people and was waiting for me for an hour. He ends up calling me and my friend bunch of horrible names before  blocking me. i also got a message from 2 of his friends saying how rude i was for arranging plans with them all only to not show up. He says he was waiting for so long he had to watch the final screening rather than the one we were originally going to watch.

my friend is very appreciative of what i did but i cant help feel a little guilty for treating my cousin that way as he’s always had my back in the past. So, AITA?",1690058248.0

childish.

 Basically 3 years ago my siblings Jennie and  Carly started smoking, our very religious parents caught her and got very mad about it. 

 Mary smoked for a while in her early 20s and stopped when she met my father(50M) Gilbert she decided to stop because he didn't really like that and they started getting interested in Mary's family religion,Gilbert learned from that and they came back to it .

That religion is very restictive well at least it wasnt for us daughters, but Mary and Gilbert pressed us a lot about it.

So when they caught my siblings smoking Gilbert got  really upset because Jennie and Carly 'sinned'. He was also very preoccupied because he says its so bad for health.

 Anyways they didnt stop after that but they got caught  again and gilbert got mad again, Mary especially was very against it too the first time and was saying things like "" You know i tried it too when i was young, i kept telling its so bad and you seem like you didn't listen to anything i ever told you about it"". 

What happened that now seems like she forgot about the fact she is a experienced grown woman from what she tells, its not like i dont want her to have fun shes still not that old, but she's not mature she seems like a teenage girl . 

Mary once got drunk with Jennie's friends  embarassed herself by throwing up in front of them and peeing herself and tried to justify her actions saying ' she didnt know  that was going that far"" like she doesnt know her limit with drinking at her age.

 Jennie's friends are all around 19yo,mary lets some teenagers 'influence' her, by nothing but just smoking in front of her. 

No one ever told Mary to start, but it's a big deal, even for her health since she already has some problems with her teeth & throat on which she spent a lot on  and adding the smoking this can ruin her as well in my opinion. 

We, jennie carly & i got to keep the secret from Gilbert , because she's gonna be in big trouble if he finds out. 

Mary and Gilbert argue a lot in fact they should just split up. Mary still doesn't care and doesn't understand how big of a deal it is.that just seems like a whim, she does it for no reason. 

Mary even made Jennie and Carly get in trouble multiple times by threwing some cigarette butts on the roof of the garage near the balcony where they smoke. 

Jennie told Gilbert it was her fault and got scolded instead of her.We tried to tell her multiple times to stop smoking Mary's making us go into trouble by keeping a secret so important to my dad, but she just doesn't care. 

so im considering telling Gilbert. its not nice to see them argue but at least she'll stop and gilbert will know.

Since university is starting again and I have also made commitments during the week that I have to attend to, it is very inconvenient for me to stay with my mum as my apartment is quite far away and I don't drive. So I wanted to move back to my apartment during the week and come back on the weekend (Fri-Sun) to help out.

Issue: My traditional grandmother just called me and expressed that it is disrespectful for to go back to my apartment during the week to fulfil my commitments. She said that it is the bare minimum to stay the whole week and told me to cancel my commitments because my mum is sick. She also got very emotional with me that I don't love and value my mother (which is completely false). coming from Vietnam, I am expected to have a responsibility to help my mum and be there for her. also told me that she and the family is disappointed with me that I am neglecting my mum and no longer spend time with her anymore. in addition to this, she also to told me to stop living out of home and spend more time here instead. 

I'm not sure what to do, and I'm so tired with this constant expectation of me to constantly be at home even though I have moved out. I also don't want to cancel on my commitments because it has already been planned for a while. I do want to spend time with my family and i have no problem with helping out but I also want them to understand that I am an adult now and I want to live independently. but they seem to not understand this nor respect it.

AITA for wanting to return from me and my brother's vacation one day earlier.,2,157elji,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157elji/aita_for_wanting_to_return_from_me_and_my/,7,"I (twenties male) recently graduated from university and started applying for jobs in Amsterdam. During the job application process my older brother proposed to go to a 6-day vacation for which he booked airplane tickets and 4 nights in hotel (other 2 nights we still had to figure out). 

That means we agreed on this trip in the process of me finding the job which is uncertain though I really need money. Note that we don't live at the same city and the return ticket was for Berlin where he lives and where we planned to spend another week. 

Surprisingly I found a job and they wanted me to start immediately under the condition that I cannot go on the vacation this month but next month because there is a lot of work and other people already took time off. I accepted the job, but I successfully negotiated and got 4 days off (which means 6 days with weekend) and I will be able to use one airplane ticket and all 4 nights in hotel. It became apparent that the returned ticket would have to be rebooked from Berlin to Amsterdam and that the second part of trip would have to be postponed for September.   

The issue started when I expressed that I want to go back on the night of the 5th day of vacation, so I have one day to get unpack and rest before going back to office. My brother started telling me that he does not understand my reasoning and he want me to stay until the last day. He started being frustrated and told me that I don't listen to him and that I am selfish for wanting to do only what I want to do. I told him that I look forward to our trip and that it is fine because we will use all hotel night we have.

He became very annoying and stubborn and stopped communicating about making plans concerning the reshaping of our vacation. Even though he did not have a determined plan for the last day he did not want to accept my offer to take the 1-hour train, spend the day in Barcelona and then I would go to airport, and he would spend one more day in the city alone. 

AITA and petty for not wanting to back down and sacrifice my rest day to make him happy. ",1690118104.0
AITA for insisting on going on the family vacation of my ex boyfriend?,4310,155ycgy,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155ycgy/aita_for_insisting_on_going_on_the_family/,1537,"My (34f) and ex boyfriend (25m) were together for a year and a half. Our breakup was amicable (I never assumed it would last given the age difference) I got along well with his family, even with his mother who (understandably) wasn’t a fan of our relationship given the age gap, but did like me as a person. 

Before our breakup, we were invited to a destination wedding of his cousin in Hawaii. I was asked to make the arrangements for flights and hotel. I didn’t mind, so we made the arrangements together, selecting the place and flight times and I put it all on my credit card with the promise that they would pay back their portions when they could. (Over $2k each) I have a good job and could pay off the whole trip and I was happy to do it to save them interest on a credit card. 

Since then we broke up. 

Recently I got an email from his mother asking for her flight and hotel information. I politely reminded her that they would need to pay back their portion (it has been 3 months since we booked the trip) and asked if they would reimburse me for my portion of the hotel/Airbnb since we broke up and I wouldn’t be attending. At first her response was cool, but polite saying that I would get my money eventually. I didn’t respond. She wrote back again with a much different tone demanding the information for the hotel/Airbnb and I said I was causing undo stress while they were planning for this big trip. I replied that I would happily share that information once I was reimbursed. She said that I would not be reimbursed for my portion of the accommodation expenses and that she was going to tell everyone how terrible I was for holding the hotel information hostage. 

I texted my ex and asked what was happening and why things had taken such a turn. He said I was being unreasonable and making everything about money which was unfair since I knew they were struggling financially and I wasn’t. I said that it didn’t feel very fair to me that I was basically paying for them to go on this trip and getting nothing. He assured me that they would work on paying me back when things got better for them financially. I said that just wouldn’t work for me since I had no guarantee and no idea how long that would be and that I would still be out thousands of dollars since they didn’t want to reimburse me for my portion. 

I offered instead to let them share one room at the Airbnb and one room at the hotel but that I would be staying in one room as well. He was outraged and said I was making things weird, but my side is that I have the time off from work and paid for it so why shouldn’t I go? 

I told him that I’m still within the range to cancel the reservations if that was a better fit which he also didn’t like since prices are much higher and places are harder to find now. I won’t attend the wedding of course, but I don’t see why I can’t take the vacation that I planned and paid for. Am I the asshole?",1689969390.0

I decided to save my money from my part time job (I do college online) and play bingo and have saved up enough for an apartment with a friend. Now I can finally have space to myself and pay rent justifiably. Just days before we were going to apply and pay the security deposit to secure the apartment, my sister informs me that her fiance got into a fight with someone at the casino and it turns out hes been gambling the monthly checks she gets away and thats why she needs me to start contributing to the bills since he got locked up and she needs to save for his bail and pick up extra shifts. I didnt want to tell her that I was planning to be moving out literally the following weekend so I lied and said okay but instead took my half and applied like I had been planning to for months. I made sure to pack my one suitcase while she was at work and left while the kids were at school. Didnt have much so it was fast. By the time I had signed the lease and picked up the keys is when I called and confessed to my sister I wasnt planning on returning ever except to see my little brother and she said that Im so fake for leaving when I promised her money for bills and she cant afford rent and her fiances bail and Im a huge asshole for lying to her because she doesnt know what shes gonna do and she starts crying.

This guy she was seeing causally didn’t want to be with her but she was madly in love with him. They broke off their casually arrangement and boom a month letter she calls him and tells him she is tracking her fertility so she is in the safe zone, they have unprotected sex and she becomes pregnant. Since she’s been casually seeing this guy she’s been obsessed with being pregnant by him. She would keep pregnancy test in her house and would constantly check to see if he knocked her up. She would plan the sex around her fertility window unknown to him and engage in unprotected sex. 

Now she’s placing her baby on all of us. She messages us (her friend group) asking if we can watch her baby as she’s overwhelmed and needs a break. She will place a sense of urgency onto us until someone agrees to do so. She also asks us to chip in on the baby’s expenses and guilts us into doing things that the father should be doing.  I refuse to chip in my money and time because I work a lot and I am trying to save my money to build a stable life for potential children in the future. She’s mentioned how she notices I refuse to babysit and I am not active in helping to raise her child but ultimately no one told her to get pregnant. Sometimes I feel bad for her because she seems exhausted and overwhelmed with being a new mom and I really think her baby is adorable but I also value my free time off from work and I rather spend it doing everything but watching some else child.

We met through my best friend (19f) when they ended up as roomates at university. 

I've known my friend my enitre life we've grown up together and know literally everything about each other. I'm pretty sure my girlfriend was slightly uncomfortable with our closeness at the start but since they live together she got used to it and it also helps that my friend is into a new guy every week. 

So for the first time, my friend met this guy she really liked, and the four of us started hanging out. I felt like something was off with the dude almost immediately, I talked to my gf about it and she agreed but we didn't say anything to my friend because she usually drops guys as soon as they do something she doesn't like. But she stayed with him for a pretty long time and it was visibly affecting her so my gf decided to talk to her and ask her if things were okay, turns out everything was alright and they just had a few issues to work through. 

Fast forward to a few months my friend breaks up with her bf and tells me like a week later and my gf knew from like a month that she was thinking of ending things. I asked her if she was okay and she said she was but when she talks to my gf, she actually tells her everything. When I'm having a bad day I tell my friend everything that's going on with me we've always been like that I'm slightly hurt that it's no longer reciprocated. That was when I realized that I wasn't either her best friend or my gf's bestfriend anymore they know things everything about each other, are literally inseparable and are more excited to do things together. 

I told my girl this and she just laughed at me and then proceeded to get mad at me when she realized I was being serious. I tried to talk to her about it and she said she understood what I was trying to say but she told me that she felt weird that I was jealous about being so close to another girl and repeatedly asked me if that meant something and I clarified it didn't. I wanted to talk to my friend about this and ask her what she thought I should do but I know that involving a third person would only make things worse. I found out just yesterday that my gf told her everything, and this really upset me. AITA for this? How is it not okay for me to talk to our friend about our issues but she does the same thing?

I set proper terms when she moved in, including a 2 months notice period if she decides to move out. 

She messaged me a week ago today after not coming back for a while, saying she wasn't happy and wanted to move out, her mental health had taken a turn for the worse and she wasn't sure she liked the area we lived. I was really understanding about it and said it's sad but I obviously wanted her to be happy.  She reiterated to me the 2 months notice without me even saying anything, so I assumed everything would be fine.  

The next day she texts me saying she's found someone on Facebook ready to move in at the end of the month.  I asked her who this was and she said it was just some girl.  I said no as I was currently in the process of asking another friend of mine who's lease was about to run out so I was hoping the timings would match up.

Since I live there, I'd rather live with someone I know personally and due to my job as a dog trainer, I can't just have anyone move in.  I have a lot of anxious dogs coming in and out my place, so I need someone I trust and will be okay with the dogs being around.

After I said no to this girl on Facebook, she messaged me asking if I could get someone short term to move in until I find someone permanent and ""I get it’s contractual but I’m throwing 1.4k away, & it’s not like it’s due to any real fault of my own, & I’ve found someone who would take it and save me losing that money"".

I'm doing my best to keep the peace throughout this, saying I understand why she's asking but due to the dogs I can't just have anyone, I'd prefer someone I know and trust and I promise I am trying to find someone to move in asap so she doesn't have to pay the full two months, but if I can't find someone appropriate then that's just how it'll have to be. 

I found out a girl I know through working with dogs is looking for a place so I offered it to her as she'd be a great fit.

At the same time, my flatmate found another person who she knows who was ready to move on asap.  I've never met this girl, but I said it does sound like it could be a good fit, but I've offered it to this person who's coming to see it on Tuesday and will need a couple of days to decide.  My flatmate then responded saying that she needs an answer and if she doesn't get one by Tuesday she'll tell her friend to look elsewhere.

I then got quite a snarky message saying that if this girl I've offered it to says no then we'll need to arrange a call to have a ""proper chat"" as she's already found two people that would save her spending the money and I've turned them down.

I feel like she's going to try and get out of paying the rent if this girl says no.  I'm feeling very let down by how she's behaving in all this and I feel like I shouldn't have to just have anyone move in because it'll save her the money.

AITA for thinking my GF chose her gay friend over me for my birthday present?,446,156djio,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156djio/aita_for_thinking_my_gf_chose_her_gay_friend_over/,213,"
(Using an alt, obfuscating trivial details)

I (M40s) met a great woman. We fell in love and have been a couple for 8 months. Things have been great. We just, however, had our major fight.

Some background.

My SO has close gay friends. This is not a problem for me. I was raised in a liberal setting where sexual orientation is a non-issue. I’m not that interested in how people around me have their sex. 

During our rosy bubbles stage I have reminded my GF she needs to stay in touch with her friends - she should not lose relationships just because there’s a new guy. We both know it is hard to make new friends in our age.

I’ve never been in a relationship where my GF has close friends of the opposite sex. I however trust my GF completely, and have zero issues about her friendships.

The conflict.

Me, my GF and her gay friend (M40s) all love the same theater director. My GF told me she bought two tickets for a play almost a year in advance. I was delighted - except I wasn’t invited. The other ticket was for the gay friend. 

No problem. I was a bit dissappointed but moved on. Of course they should go together, their tickets. 

5 months on was my birthday. My GF gave me a ticket for the same performance. She explained she got a third ticket. I jokingly asked ”so you are going to be sandwhiched between me and X (her gay friend)”. 

She suddenly went silent. 

She said no. They would be sitting together in the front, while my seat was in the back. My heart sank. For some reason this felt like a slap in the face. She noticed my reaction even though I said nothing and tried to move on. She pressed with ”what’s your problem” until I gave out.

I said I would sit alone in the back as a birthday present, while she sits with her gay friend in the front. I hinted at nothing inappropriate. She got upset, and asked what’s my problem. We argued, she did not understand my pov.

I tried to explain. 

What if I arranged an exclusive dinner for her birthday, and while we got to there, I would eat with my friend while she would sit alone in the bar? I understood she did not mean it, but it felt like she made a choice between me and her friend, and I lost. I understood its wasn’t straightforward. They had the tickets, I came on later. I understood, but it did not feel right. I was upset, and could not hide it.

The friend being a man came in to play. I replied I would have been just as upset with a woman. I have to admit, however, this is not true. Somehow it situation felt even worse with a guy. I felt I was directly compared and lost. I never said this aloud. 

We could not settle and separated. We have not been in contact after extremely close 8 months. 

I am torn. My emotional reaction was immature. I tried to hide it but couldn’t. I also think she handled things poorly, and never considered my pov.

For my major work I did hyper realistic lead pencil self portrait drawings. They were probably the most impressive thing I’ve ever done with my limited creativity. 

This was over 5 years ago. I have not completed another artwork of that calibre since. I like the idea of being good at art but I work a lot and get overly frustrated and critical of anything I do attempt now. I can safely say that art does not bring me joy. 

My mum earlier today requested that I draw a hyper realistic coloured drawing of her new friends dog, which she needed to be completed in 2 weeks. Apparently the professional this friend originally wanted was booked out since she had left it far to late. My mum showed her my highschool drawings and she was set on me to do it. She also said I would be “paid handsomely”. 

I immediately declined saying that I am in no way a proper artist who can get that done in so little time, at least not in a good enough quality to be paid for. I have barely had any practice with art since highschool, I work full time hours, I’ve never drawn realistic animals nor have I ever used coloured pencils to do realism. They are expecting me to learn a new skill and pick up an old skill from years ago and then create a complete work of art in just 2 weeks! 

My dads input was that I should just “do it in my own style” and not expect to be paid if I am worried about it not looking good enough. That just completely threw me for a loop, so I said “why the fuck would I go a buy new coloured pencils and spend all my free time drawing some random woman’s dog, and not expect to be paid”. 

The response I got was “you’re supposed to like doing art”. 

I ended up getting a little heated explaining myself. The comments and expectations they had for me made be feel really bad about myself. I felt that I am not as talented as they want me to be. But I also shouldn’t be expected to do something like this right? 

Now they are both disappointed in me and mad that they now have to let their friend down. They have made me feel guilty about saying no and I’m also now feeling all depressed about my lack of creativity over the last 5 or so years. So now here I am sitting here wondering if I was just an asshole because of my own lack of productivity. AITA?

My grandparents, who are basically like my parents, have never really liked her, particularly my strong-willed and difficult old Irish-Catholic grandmother. The feeling isn’t really mutual, my wife doesn’t antagonize her, but their relationship has only deteriorated since we had our only child three years ago. The tension mainly revolves around differing beliefs on child-rearing, which all flow through me since my wife and grandmother never confront each other directly.

Despite the ongoing discord, I've always supported my wife's decisions, even when I might not entirely agree. For example, my wife wanted our child to learn to ride a balance bike, and after some initial hesitation cause I thought training wheels were better, I agreed. My grandmother strongly disapproved and even tried to give our daughter a ""real"" bike, on Christmas, in front of my wife, which I prevented. These conflicts arise during regular visits to my grandparents' house, which I used to take my daughter to every Wednesday. However, with my daughter now attending daycare five days a week, we visit less frequently.

Today, I discovered that our tent, left in my grandparents' garage, had been accidentally thrown away. As we are going camping Friday, this left us in a bind. When I mentioned the situation to my grandmother, she didn't offer any help or even offer up an “oh my god I’m sorry.” I called my wife to discuss getting a new tent, and she was understandably upset, given that this was a brand new $300 family tent we used once and I only left it there because I needed it out of the trunk to help them move something. She expressed her frustration, and although I was also angry, I wanted to avoid another fight.

After the call, my grandmother commented on my demeanor, asking why I always seemed grumpy. In response, I calmly asked if they could contribute half the cost of a new tent. This set off a tirade from my grandmother, accusing my wife of various things, including not caring about our family and providing poor Christmas presents to them every year. She brought up the bike thing again and even said she thinks my wife put our daughter in daycare 5 days so she’d see them less. She said “everyone” has always felt this way. She eventually gave me a check for $300.

Now, I'm questioning if I was wrong to ask for money since it was an accident. I was really upset. I wonder if I should be more deferential to my grandmother and my side of the family, rather than always siding with my wife. I'm worried that my actions might be causing or exacerbating the ongoing tensions between my wife and my grandparents.",1690079640.0

So last night (Saturday) my husband wanted to go to a friend’s cookout and I wasn’t up for it. We have two young boys (3) & (1) and had just gotten back from a week long vacation, so I was spent. I told my husband it was totally cool if he went and meant it. 

Right before he was leaving, around 6:45pm, the boys were especially rowdy. My husband offered to take our 3y/o to the cook out since other kids would be there and he could get some energy out. Seemed like a great plan! 

Cut to 8pm, aka bed time hour: I text my husband to check in and he tells me that our son has really only had chips since they arrived late and missed the food. He stated they would stop on the way home and grab something to eat. I replied that sounded good but suggested they leave soon since it was already 8pm. Husband agreed.

Now it’s 9:30pm and they have not returned home. My husband has not responded to my latest text nor answered when I called at 9:15pm or 9:17pm. I’m getting nervous. Finally, my husband calls me back and as soon as I pick up the phone I can tell he’s had too much to drink. His speech is slurred and slow. I say “It sounds like you’ve been drinking” he says “Ok. Well we are just around the corner be home soon.”

Everyone gets home safe and I put our toddler to bed. Afterwards, I approach my husband about him driving our child while impaired. He doesn’t seem concerned by it and his apology is “It was probably some poor decision making on my part” and the proceeds to flip the script about how I don’t create a supportive environment for him to articulate his needs. 

I call a break in the discussion to avoid things getting heated. After my husband has taken a shower I go back to him and express how I don’t feel he was truly sorry for endangering our son and I am concerned it will happen again. He then says “IF I didn’t say sorry, I should have.” Still not an apology (and I called him out on using the If statement).

Finally he says sorry but by now it’s too late. I don’t believe him. I think he still thinks he made a fine decision. If the script was flipped I’d be the most contrite person, asking for forgiveness and asking how I could repair the trust that was broken. But I’m getting none of that.

I assume this sunbird wanted to use the nest, because I have never seen a bird visiting my balcony twice. So, today i decided to touch the bird. What was I thinking. I mean, i am a monster. I am crying right now. I was having so much trouble catching it and still i wanted it in my hands. Now, the real trouble begins. It somehow entered my room, and hit my fan.

Then, i decided to feed it some water. Then I applied some turmeric, to prevent infection. I thought i would keep it for two days, i didn't want to stay so i released it in my balcony.

I've known my crush, 19F, since an event in my hometown last July for the upcoming first year students to get to know each other and meet graduates from the school. We met there, and I got her instagram but didn't get much of a chance to talk to her beyond that. I didn't really have a good reason to reach out online, so I let it be.

So this friend turns 19 in a few weeks. One time we were hanging out and he mentioned he had a dance to go to. He said he didn't have a date yet, and his roommate asked about some of his female friends; my crush was one of the names mentioned. I asked how they knew each other, and my friend said they met during a program the university hosted during the pandemic for high schoolers interested in attending the university.

It's weird how he knows her better than I do considering I'm from the same town she is and he's from an entirely different state, but being his friend allowed me to get to know her better. Over the next few months, I'd ask about her and if I saw him out with her I'd insert myself and make it a group hang out. I once asked him if she ever talks about me, and he said he couldn't remember, so I'm taking that as a no, but she had accepted my instagram follow request.

I'm a great cook, and baking isn't that far off from what I can tell. My friend loves to bake, and I know my crush likes the stuff he's baked in the past. He even baked a birthday cake for her; this was before I knew the two knew each other, otherwise I would have thought to do that too. I know my friend was going to bake his own cake, because his roommate told our friends that we should consider getting him cake pans as a group gift and he can give it to him before the actual birthday.

I know that my crush will be at his birthday party, since she was at his last year; she posted it on her instagram. I'm thinking if I get the cake pans that my friend asked for, I can bake the cake for his birthday. This will allow me to show off my skills, which I doubt he'll mind since everyone at the party has had his baking before. Why would he want to bake on his birthday anyways? I can give him the pans after I'm done with them so he can get the gift he wanted anyways.

After all of this, I want to ask my crush out before the party ends, because she'll see how thoughtful and hard working I am.

I asked his roommate about this, and he said I'd be an asshole since I'd be giving him used bakeware, and then asked if I would be offering to bake if my crush wasn’t there. I don't think the reasoning matters in the end compared to the outcome. Roommate also said that it’s my friend's day, and that if I wanted to ask her out I could ask her any other day. I don't think there's a conflict here.

My friend isn't interested in my crush, and I'm sure he'd be happy with setting me up with her. And I can't imagine my crush being interested in my friend. So would I be the asshole?",1690128717.0
AITA for humiliating a teenage boy and calling him out for being a bad dog owner?,0,157iox9,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157iox9/aita_for_humiliating_a_teenage_boy_and_calling/,10,"I was going to get the newspaper this morning when I noticed a chocolate Labrador in my yard, sniffing around. Well, of course it decided to release a big steamer right there on the lawn, and then kick up some dirt and wander out. 

I followed it outside, so that I could get its owner to clean it up. I saw the owner who was quite far ahead, he was a teenage boy and another Labrador was wandering alongside him, a little behind. He was clearly not watching either of his dogs. 

The other dog then stopped at the grass strip beside the curb, and proceeded to also let one out. The owner was too busy walking ahead to notice nor care. The dog then wandered into someone's yard and so I watched it from the entrance. The dog sniffed one of the flower beds, rolled around in it (essentially flattening the flower bed) and then squatted and peed on it. The dog then kicked back a few pretty sizeable chunks of dirt/flowers, and wandered off into the yard further. 

By this point, the owner had realised and come calling the dog, so it bounded out to where it had originally taken its #2. I took that chance to confront the owner, basically saying that his dogs had pooped both here and in my lawn. I explained that I'd appreciate if he could clean both up. The boy told me he had no bags, so I said I would get him a couple. He was visibly annoyed with me. 

We went back to my house, and I told him to wait there. I made him pick up the poop with some shopping bags, and told him to dispose of it later. He gave me a sarcastic 'thanks for wasting my time' and I told him to watch his mouth. He then called me a dickhead and wandered off. 

On my walk around the neighbourhood later, I found both the shopping bag filled with poop had been chucked outside my fence, and the other dog's poop was still there. 

AITA for humiliating him in this way? He said I was a dickhead and wasting his time, I think he needs to learn some respect and also be a better owner. I don't own dogs, but I know its a risk letting them into other people's yards, not to mention its disrespectful. ",1690128447.0
"AITA for walking out on my misogynistic, homophobic uncle?",0,157io8m,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157io8m/aita_for_walking_out_on_my_misogynistic/,7,"My (29F) uncle (60M) is a misogynist, transphobe, homophobe, etc, but I'm very close with my aunt, so I spend a lot of time around him. As such, I avoid certain topics so I don't have to hear his rants. Not easy to do, because he'll jump on the smallest thing, and blow it up. As you'll see:

2020 was tough on everyone, including me. Things happened, I was severely stressed, and a good chunk of my hair fell out. It wasn't too heartbreaking because I've been wanting to do the Big Chop for a while, so I went to my hairdresser and had it all cut off.

Ever since then, every time I've gone back to cut off the new growth, she's made snide comments and scoffed/rolled her eyes when I say to keep cutting. ""Wow, you really don't want hair, do you?"" ""I'm not doing it any shorter or you'll be bald.""

Anyway, I was at my aunt's house. She and I share the same hairdresser, so she asked me how the lady was doing since it was obvious I'd just gotten another cut. I told her she was getting on my nerves and I wasn't going back to her anymore. Then I said, ""I hate it when Black women are part of the problem.""

My aunt nodded, and that was the end of the conversation. Until my uncle chimed in.

He asked what I meant by that. I explained, and then he went off. Launched into another rant about how men have it worse. They're the ones judged for their hair, and I don't know what I'm talking about.

I asked him to stop many times, said he was upsetting me, and that I didn't need him to tell me what it's like to live my own life. He wouldn't stop, so I got up and walked out.

I haven't been back to their house, or done anything other than exchange polite greetings with him since. He's got problems for sure, but I have a habit of swallowing my tongue until the dam breaks, then I blow up and cut the person out of my life.

Which is what I did here. Part of me thinks I should've tried to have a conversation with him, instead of walking out, because it's not like I ever directly told him how much the stuff he says pisses me off.

AITA for not immediately telling my maternal family about my dad's death?,19,156zz9m,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156zz9m/aita_for_not_immediately_telling_my_maternal/,9,"My 19f dad died of natural causes lying on top of his bed. My brother 15 was the only person living with him and called me on a random Sunday at 4pm my time and 3pm for him. When I picked up he was very obviously shaking and kept repeating ""dad's not waking up he's 100% dead"".
It was very unusual for my dad to not wake up as he was a light sleeper so I calmed my brother down and told him to try splashing my dad with cold water. When he didn't respond I immediately knew something was wrong so I told my brother to call an ambulance and call me back when they arrive. Sure enough 20 minutes later I get a call informing me that my dad was dead and the paramedic was saying I needed to sign some papers since my brother is a minor. Issue is I have been living in sweden with my grandmother for the past year so I instead called my big brother 22 and told him he needs to get off work.
Now this might be me overthinking for no reason but I assumed that they would need some time to process everything both emotionally and legally and that my brothers would call me when they were ready to start telling people. Just give me a heads up you know.
Apparently not.
Not even 2 hours later my grandmother called me and told me to open the door for my auntie because she had come over. I thought nothing of it because all my aunts and uncles come over at random times with no notice but when I got down there I saw my 2 aunties and my cousin who was mouthing an apology to me. The first thing my aunts said to me was that they heard that my dad died and they couldn't believe I had done this to them. I was confused but just let it go and went back up to my grandmother's apartment. The second I walked in my grandmother threw herself into my arms and starting howling so loudly it genuinely upset me and I can still remember the way it pierced my ears. She was screaming about how they a loved me but I clearly don't love them back since I could pull such a stunt and in a direct translation ""this move is not nice"".
I knew at this point that literally everybody would know so the first thing I did was call my uncle (dad's brother) so he could at least hear it from one of us instead of sone random geezer my dad was friends with. My uncle held a gathering at his house and asked for me to be there so my aunties took me there and I was first greeted by my mom's brother who yet again asked how I could be sk selfish and that I should be more considerate since they are my family.
I am just so confused because my dad was literally declared dead for 1 and a bit hours before this so we're they expecting me to get off the phone with my brothers then immediately run to them or something? I didn't grow up with my family in sweden so often times they try to over compensate by forcefully involving themselves in every aspect in my life and I want to believe this is another one of those moments but wrote this just incase I violated some sort of family code I wasn't aware of.",1690071912.0

For a little back story, my house does not have AC and gets extremely hot in the summer months, to the point where it’s unbearable even with fans going. I suggested that we go sleep in the trailer which is parked in the back on a concrete parking pad so we can plug it into the house and turn on the AC and he agreed. Almost immediately after I got a text from my grandma (she adopted me at 15, and I still live with her) that people were coming to look at the trailer at 10 AM (It is currently up for sale as we don’t take it camping anymore)just to make sure we would be awake and out of it by then. I assured her that we would be, and that I would also make sure it was cleaned out and presentable. At 2 AM my boyfriend and I decided to sleep in my room since it had cooled off enough, and my bed is more comfortable. When I woke up, I was planning on getting up to clean it out right away but I was hungover and needed a few minutes to collect myself. My boyfriend woke up at the same time as me, or earlier (he is a morning person with an ungodly amount of energy right off the bat, I am the complete opposite in the AM). As I was waking up and assessing my hangover he looks over to me and says “go go go, you need to get up and clean the trailer, go go go go go”. I have told him multiple times that when he rushes me and tells me to do stuff repeatedly, it makes me angry and overwhelmed. I have extreme anxiety, and I am working on bettering myself but some things just set me off like no other, and I couldn’t tell you why. I know he does not mean any harm when he does it, but I have talked to him nicely about it countless times. After a minute or so, I went to get up but he grabbed my arm so I couldn’t leave to clean up, again I know he means no harm but I was already pissed off because of the “Go go go clean” comments so I asked him to please let go of my arm. He does not, so I ask him again to please let go of my arm and he still doesn’t. At this point i’m stressed and overwhelmed so I rip my arm out of his grasp to get up and that made him angry. I told him that I asked him nicely but he did not listen after 2 times so I got fed up. This happens often, I ask him nicely to stop doing things that I do not like multiple times, and he doesn’t listen, it’s almost like a game to him until i get angry, then i’m the bad guy. I am very much aware that my patience and temper is not as great as his, and that I could handle situations a lot better than I currently do, but when i get that overwhelmed I feel no emotion other than anger to the point where I want to cry. Again, I am working on it. So I ask again, AITA for flipping out at my boyfriend?",1690128323.0
WIBTA if I refuse to drive my father to the airport?,0,157im3y,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157im3y/wibta_if_i_refuse_to_drive_my_father_to_the/,3,"I (W24) and my girlfriend (W26) are moving in August. My father is returning from a trip to our current apartment (he pays my rent, my gf pays her half of the rent, it's been a recurring conflict that he shows up and uses the apartment basically whenever he wants) the same weekend and is flying back to his home country. 

I asked him when he's returning to our apartment today and apparently he's planning on coming back during the only weekend my gf's parents have time to help us move (her dad has a big truck). I also have had an event planned for a few months (it's dumb but it's a club night I've really been looking forward to with a friend that's moving the week after sort of as a goodbye party) the night from Saturday to Sunday, but my gf assured me that it would be okay if I helped with moving everything on Saturday and Sunday I could sleep in and we could take it easy so I originally didn't think it would be a problem. He said that he doesn't care about the move, but he was expecting me to drive him to the airport on Sunday. He has not mentioned this before as I would definitely remember it. The airport is about 2 1/2 hours away in a large city that I've never driven in. I am not a confident driver at all and he knows this. He does have some alternatives (train, taxi (though thats expensive), taking a train the night before and staying at an airport hotel (obviously suboptimal)). 

Increasing my stress level is that I'm starting a very demanding job at the beginning of August and am already highly pre-stressed from both the move and starting my job. I was kind of hoping to be able to do something fun that weekend and just move in peace without having this added stress, but I also feel bad because he's already mad at me for saying that it's inconvenient for me.. 

Reasons I might be TA

\- Lack of good alternatives for my father to get to the airport, car is definitely most convenient

\- I have a driver's license and theoretically have the time

\- Club night is a bad excuse to not do it and I would probably have enough time during the day after driving him to relax

\- He paid for my car

Reasons I might not be TA

\- he didn't tell me about this in advance, only after I asked today and is now expecting me to do it

\- I am not a confident driver especially longer drives like this over highways etc and he knows this

\- I would miss the event I already have tickets to and was really looking forward to 

\- he could take the train or choose a more inconvenient solution for himself

\- I am trying to avoid events that would stress me in an already stressful time (cannot highlight enough that I really hate driving)",1690128265.0

IAMA 39 female and have always been the jealous one, but my DH, who is 37, has decided in his older age to discover he is a jealous man. We've both had a mutual gamer friend for about 5 years now. The gamer is married with two kids and lives across the country. The most he has been is a friend that I have never met and will probably never meet. Me and DH both game with him nightly. Me, DH & gamer like to make dirty jokes, but DH feels that me and gamer are too comfortable and sometimes go too far with our jokes, and that one, if not both, have some kind of feelings towards each other. I just always felt we were just bros talking, and sometimes I or he would make a comment about our characters we play in a sexual manner, BUT so do he and DH. DH feels that because I'm married F, it should be a bit different than two bros. Until recently, me and a gamer have played more frequently with each other because I work over night, time zones and gamer stays up late. On more than a few occasions, DH has overheard us make comments about each others characters or jokes toward each other that can come across as inappropriate. (This is nothing that we would not have said in front of DH.) DH has pointed out things we've said a few times in the past few weeks that bother him, and I'd always shrug it off because, to me, we have always talked the same whether DH was around or not. When DH came to me this last time and stated he was deleting gamer, I also deleted gamer and left our chats because I did not want DH to feel bad, but after a few days, I felt bad ghosting gamer because, well, he has been a friend for a long time and he had no idea why me and DH left chats and why DH had blocked him. After I stated to gamer in a message why I had deleted him, he said that DH feelings are valid because he is my partner, and out of what I feel is respect, he has not tried to message me since. I do agree that the jokes went too far at times, and if I heard DH say this to another woman, I would be extremely pissed, BUT again, I am a jealous woman because DH in the far past has talked to a women in a game or online in a very legit and inappropriate way multiple times with multiple women. He has proven over the past few years that he has grown as a DH, and I am learning to forgive. This is not an excuse for anyone's behavior. I'm just giving you an idea as to why I would be mad if he talked to another woman like me, and gamer have. DH, in a way, is also the one who started the dirty jokes in the first place. He likes to oversexualize me in conversion when we are gaming with gamer, to the extent that he has described the color of my nipples and things he likes to do to me.

I adore my brother but we have strong opinions on this matter. 

This stems from our sister’s (27F) toxic relationship. Her and her husband have very explosive fights/arguments (screaming, swearing and in some cases physical) and when they’re in this zone, they forget where they are or who they’re around. These fights have happened at birthdays, work events, special events or simply in the street.

I have two young children (5M and 1F) and my sister has one (2M). My partner and I have recently gone non contact with my sister as our kids have been exposed to these arguments several times and the older they have gotten, the more aware and frightened they’ve become. I want an acknowledgement of poor behaviour and a promise to change before I can allow them back into our lives. It’s made things very uncomfortable for the whole family. We’ve never received an apology, and my mum says to stop causing drama and move on as my sister never apologises to anyone, “It’s just who she is”. Anytime our  parents have tried to get involved my sister punished them by disappearing for a while.

My issue is that despite whole heartedly agreeing with our choice, my brother continues to hang out socially with my sister. He says it’s to see his nephew and make sure he’s doing ok. We ended up having an argument because I would like his support, as they don’t think their behaviour is a problem and as long as I’m the only one calling them on it, they’ll never change. 
I also think if he’s worried about his nephew, that’s even more reason to call out their behaviour and put a stop to it rather than checking in to make sure he’s ok after the fact. 

We’re barely speaking and I miss him dearly. But am I wrong for thinking he should do more?

Note: I don’t expect him to go no contact. But acting like there isn’t a problem does nothing to help anyone.",1690127036.0

One of them, Lily (28?), has a puppy who usually gets along with our dogs. She would bring her puppy over whenever she came to visit. But the puppy is REALLY high energy and seemingly never has an off switch. 

That night, Lily informed us she would be late as she would be out for dinner with another friend. She didn’t show up until past 11pm, puppy in tow (actually out of our expectation as we originally thought she would consider our situation). Little guy literally charged into the flat and almost knocked the spayed dog over. Throughout the entire night it was me trying to get my dog away from the puppy. It got to the point her wound was visibly red and sore and I got slightly irritated and basically told her to control her pup, which I have never done up till this point.

I’m still a bit irritated this morning and my partner suggested I should let Lily know to give us a heads up in the future if she’s bringing her pup over.

I have lived in the US for over 10 years now, but my introverted personality makes it challenging for me to make friends. My girlfriend, on the other hand, is an extrovert.  
Two days ago, we attended a birthday party where I didn't know many people. Although I felt uncomfortable, I was fine because I had my girlfriend with me. The problem arose when she went off somewhere else with her best friend, leaving me alone.  
Here is where I might be an asshole:  
Normally, I'd find a quiet place or hang out with people I know or like when she does this at parties. At this particular party, I met Jasmine \[32F\], an acquaintance from work, who introduced me to her little sister Emma \[early 20s\], a soccer/football enthusiast. We bonded over our shared interests and talked for over an hour, mostly to each other.  
When I finally decided to rejoin my girlfriend, she seemed somewhat distant, and after arriving at our apartment that night, she accused me of flirting with Emma.

I am admittedly oblivious to flirtation, even with my current girlfriend, who made the first move, surprising me at the time. I reassured my girlfriend that both Jasmine and Emma knew about her, and Emma never asked for my number or tried anything obvious like a lot of touching during the conversation, so there was no reason for concern. But I apologized to her if I made her uncomfortable and promised to limit my interactions with Emma if we met again. I didn't want to make her jealous or concerned in the first place.  
Despite my apology, my girlfriend is still upset, fearing I'm looking for a younger replacement for her. As she ""knows women like this"". My friends' opinions are divided; some say I'm the asshole for making her jealous and insecure, while others have argued I was just enjoying the party, as she does with her friends without me.

AITAH For stopping a hike and making us go back with our 5 month old?,11,15731o3,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15731o3/aitah_for_stopping_a_hike_and_making_us_go_back/,25,"Hi Everyone!

I told my wife  would be posting. It seems we are in an agree to disagree standoff and i thought i would let the reddit world decide our fate! So here is the story, whi h happened less than 24 hrs ago.

Backround: My wife and i are new parents to a 5.5 month old.

Today is a good friends 40th birthday. For his bday he wanted to hike in to a spot on a lake that is an approximate 3 mile hike in, no car access. He did this to start the weeekend, on friday, with his kids and wife. Various others were planning to hike in at various times throught the weekend. 

The wife and I (both 40's, i know we are old) were going to hike in to meet them just for a few hours and hang out but not stay the night. We had packed everything we  thought we needed and left. 

The drive to the trail head was about 1 to 1.5 hours long one way. Once we got there we realuzed we had forgotten the strap on baby carrier we had planned to use, so we had no way of carrying  the baby beside either in her car seat, or just in our arms. 

Once realized my wife said, ""I am just gonna carry her in my arms"", I stated  some concerns  but went with it at  first. As we got deeper into the trail i realized the situation more and more. The hike is a typical hike., although only 3ish miles, it is still rocks, loose gravel, some narrow wash out spots. So after the 2nd toe kick on a rock I saw my wife do(which she denies), I finally said no, and made us turn around, after about 1.1 miles. I was thought there couldve been tooany spot of tripping or somethinging happening where a 5 month  old would not have the protective reactions, nory wife being able to predict where some loose dirt or gravel have way....

So, reddit, am I the asshole in making us turn around on the hike, even though my wife says she would've carried our 5 month old in on the trail, for 6 miles round trip?",1690080737.0
AITA for pissing off both my parents and my girlfriend?,11,1573lc3,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1573lc3/aita_for_pissing_off_both_my_parents_and_my/,41,"I (29f) have been married to my wife Jan (30f) for 6 years, and we’ve been dating for 11 years. We met on the first day of college and have been together pretty much ever since. I came out soon after and my whole family took it really really well. There was no drama, no objections and nothing changed. My parents attended our wedding, cried, did all the normal loving parent things. They have never, ever said anything remotely homophobic either to me or behind my back to my siblings - I’m close to my siblings and I know for sure they would call my parents out and tell me if they had. 

So recently my mother called me and said since my dad is turning 60 next month, the only thing he wished for was for all of his kids to be able to be in the same place at the same time, so they wanted to pay for us all to go on holiday together. I said that was really generous and asked if partners are also invited so I could plan around it better and she said that Jan would have to pay for herself because they couldn’t afford it. I understood and said we’d pay for her part as soon as I had cleared it with her. She agreed and so we transferred the very expensive full amount to my parents the next day. I called my sister and found out that my parents are actually paying for her, her husband, their 4 kids, my brother and his wife to come and that my parents mentioned to her that they could comfortably afford to pay for us all. I was confused, and then later that week got another call from my mother asking why my siblings were outraged and calling them homophobic for excluding Jan.

I told them that it did seem homophobic but that I’d assumed that they could no longer afford to pay for everyone because they didn’t want to separate my sister from her kids. They said that wasn’t the case and they were just worried about what people would think and that they didn’t want us to experience homophobia abroad. I said that was BS and a weak excuse. We argued and it culminated in them telling me things they had ‘learned’ at their new church. I hung up. I told Jan and she said she was glad I’m not going anymore and I said I was but she didn’t have to. I feel I would be able to reason with them in person as they weren’t like this before. All parties are mad at me. AITA?",1690082405.0
AITA leaving despite promising to babysit for at least a year,3,1578f5r,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1578f5r/aita_leaving_despite_promising_to_babysit_for_at/,21,"AITA for wanting to leave despite promising to babysit for at least a year. I (22F) just graduated from university and moved in with my sister (34F) and husband to help with childcare of my 2 nephews (2.5M & 10M). Backstory: I had previously moved in before college to help my sister with her then newborn. Nephew (10M) was 6/7 and exhibited really bad behavior mirroring behavior of a toddler in their terrible two’s, this made taking care of a newborn extremely difficult. I was cooking, cleaning, taking care of a colicky baby, a 6/7 with bad behavior, a poorly trained dog and occasionally the husband’s niece all at the same time. Mind you, I had agreed to care give my newborn nephew because my sister had no help. This was my normal for an entire year before I went off to school. 

Currently, I am caring for the 2 nephews, cooking, cleaning, driving around both boys for their sports, tutoring, and montessori (only for toddler twice a week). I use my own money I have left over from my student loans to pay for gas and food for the kids but I don’t have to pay for rent. Often times, I’m left feeling really drained at the end of the day because I’m up early and sleep late. I don’t really feel appreciated for how much effort I put into caring for my sister’s kids. Although the older kid gets tutoring twice a week, he still needs extra help with assignments which take HOURS because it takes longer for him to understand the concepts of the assignments. I juggle between cooking, helping with homework and appeasing a very needy toddler. Yes I receive thank you for dinner but not necessarily for how much time and effort I put into caring for the children and house. My sister is much older than me and often yells at me for little things (because she has a very short temper and lacks the ability to treat me respectfully) which adds onto the reason why I want to back out of my promise. I’ve been hired at a new job and I was asked to work part time by my sister to be able to take care of the kids on the days I’m not working. So I would be working 2-3 days at an hourly wage and taking care of the kids those 4 other days. I really want to back out of my promise because I feel extremely overwhelmed with the amount of responsibilities. I wasn’t prepared to be bombarded with so many schedules and responsibilities that I often cry myself to sleep because I have no other outlets of my stress and sadness. I feel that paying rent would be a lot less stressful than caring for an entire family who doesn’t necessarily treat me the best.

AITA for not cooking for my husband?,5,1579m2v,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1579m2v/aita_for_not_cooking_for_my_husband/,14,"Background: I (24f) married my husband (31m) less than a year ago and I’m currently in my second trimester of my first pregnancy. We’re south asian and live with his parents and older brother. I’ve recently got a 9-5 office job as I’ve been struggling to stay out of my overdraft (my husband doesn’t want me to work full time as he says he can provide for me but won’t force me to stay out of work) and I’ve been absolutely drained from morning sickness and really low iron levels. His mother is elderly and overbearing, constantly telling me that when we move out she’ll be coming round everyday to keep an eye out for how I look after her son and if I feed him on time like she does.  The kitchen is cluttered and filthy unless i clean up after everyone every day, morning and evening.

Up until we got married it was his mum doing his laundry as well as asking him what curry he wants made fresh for him everyday and having his plate and glass ready for when she will walk him over to the pan to pick out the biggest piece of chicken for him. Post marriage I’ve taken on the expected daughter in law role of waking up and always asking the MIL if she needs help with cooking and cleaning up pots and pans every morning. 

At one point before I got my full time job it just felt like i was waking up to his mums pots and pans and not able to do housework on my own schedule before I could even have breakfast without being told to do the obvious chores in front of me. I felt like I was thought of in a low manner, maybe I’m just overthinking it but when his mum would say to him to leave his dishes in the sink as I’ll do it (she would never ask me, she would just tell him that I’ll do this and likewise with offering tea or his laundry). 

While helping her in the kitchen she would constantly praise her son, constantly asking closed questions like “is there anyone else that you know who is above my son?” and how lucky I am to be with him and have a mother in law like her. I never mentioned this to him to avoid conflict but I did voice to him how I was struggling to adjust to moving into a new town with no job, no friends or family around me and feeling like my life just revolved around his mums dishes and when she wanted to cook for him. He then went on to tell me how I’m complaining about doing the bare minimum in his mums house when she doesn’t ask much of me, charge rent and that I don’t even bother to cook for him when it’s his love language.

Since then he has been passive aggressive when I have tried to make him food in ways such as just saying no to what I offer him or saying his mum will cook him something when I ask what he would like me to cook for him. 

I want to spend quality time with him but he doesn’t talk to me properly the way he does with his friends or siblings since I got my full time job. I can’t tell if I’m supposed to just quit my job or exhaust myself with everything to be financially independent.

AITA for calling shower sex gross,0,157gmpb,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157gmpb/aita_for_calling_shower_sex_gross/,15,"I an asexual was discussing a summerhouse trip we were driving home from with my sister and a shared friend.

The cabin we had rented had large sleeping halls and we talked about how no one was having sex in the hall while others were sleeping despite there being a few couples among our 17 people friend group (ages 20-24)

We talked about it being a violation of other people's personal space doing it in the shared hall. And as nothing more than an passing thought I mentioned that I felt the same about the showers. 

And for reasons Im still confused about it kinda exploded. Both my sister and her friend are in long term relationships. And would reasonably want alone time with their partners. I'm not telling them not to, but using a shared space for sex id probably also be using the same day makes me feel really uncomfortable. 

And I voiced that discomfort saying that even if I didn't know about it happening I still found it rude and gross. I think I raised my voice, but never shouted. I felt very attacked and accused of not empathizing with couples (which I do) and wanting to control them (which I won't)

Mocking me that I'd never be able to step into any room cause someone at some point probably had sex in there. Which isn't my point. Theres a big difference between 6 months ago and 20min ago. (And me having to be naked in that room makes it worse imo)

I know they're gonna do it. They probably did. Since its the only privacy they could really get for 5 days. I'm not gonna give them grief over it, but if the conversation passes it I want them to know how I feel. 

I'm probably at least a bit asshole for how i handled the conversation, but...

Am I the asshole for voicing my wish that shared spaces could be sex free?",1690123475.0

I got to school late and couldn’t get a space close by, so I parked on someone’s drive instead of the verge. They left a note on my car telling me I was parked on private property, and not to park there. I balled it up and threw it on the ground. The homeowner saw me and told me to pick it up and I refused. They then said to not park there. I said it was only to pick up my kids. They then started recording me and the car. I asked why and said they couldn’t record me. They said that I was on private property and the video would prove my car was on the property and who was driving the car, as that’s what the police advised them to do. I said I didn’t want them to record me or the kids, and they said they didn’t start recording until after the kids got in the car, and that legally they can record me as I was on private property.

M and I have been best friends since 5th grade. Went to the same college and M met T. T is a homebody and prefers roleplay forums, Wattpad etc (important). T does not like me. When M lived with T senior year with 2 others, T would go to her room when I would come over. Before that any attempts to relate got shut down. I have always been kind to her. 

M moved to a new place last year. When I see T there, T is rude. Short, rolls her eyes, laughs at something I say. 4 months ago, we were the last two left at a gathering and I asked her what was up and she was coy. I said basically that I’d be open if she ever wanted to talk, we could get along better than this, she agreed. After that it got WAY worse. It was noticeable to everyone. M said she was sorry a month ago and that she would ask T to be nicer to me. I hadn’t seen T after that till now.

So, yesterday it was M’s 25th birthday. I walked in and everyone is sitting in the living room. I said, “hey guys!” as they got up to give me a hug and say hi. When I said that, T says, “don’t you get that not everyone is a guy here? What’s wrong with you?” I paused, went umm. She goes, “there are literally people here that are NB and F, it’s fucked up to use ‘guys.’ Get that through your head.” 

Everyone was looking at me and it felt wrong that they were just waiting to see what I’d do, M too. I don’t know how long it was silent for but it felt like a while. I cracked. I said, “you know, you’ve had a problem with me since day one, and I never got it. And now this, you want to embarrass me in front of everyone? Fuck you. Get the fuck off your computer and touch some grass, this is how people talk sometimes in the real world” then looked at everyone, shook my head, turned to M and said, “This isn’t okay and the fact that all of you are just standing here is so wrong. I hope you can still have a good birthday. I’m sorry. I’m leaving” and I left. I’m sure I wasn’t as smooth as this because by the time I turned to M I was about to cry but this was basically what was said. 

M texted me begging to come back and then later said the party fell apart. She said T started crying, saying how mean I was, that she was just standing up for the F and NB that were there (7 of us). I guess people felt awkward and it lasted ~2hrs. M is devastated, she said that her birthday was ruined because of me. She was sorry that T was a jerk, but I could have brushed it off like I usually do and I took it too far. 

3 other people have messaged me saying the same, one person said they don’t want to hang out anymore and then blocked me on Messenger. These people have seen T treat me like this all the time and never said anything. I can understand I should have handled it better, but I feel like T tried to set me up and it worked. I feel like they’re blaming me and T gets a pass again. I don’t know. AITA?",1690036689.0

We initially had a period where she said she wanted to be a part of my life but that ultimately fizzled out (?) If I asked her who I’m living with next semester (my sophomore year of college) she probably wouldn’t know. We don’t really talk in that sense but I’ve just accepted that.

Anyway lately she only comes to my room/calls me or talks to me for extended periods when she needs a favor from me or wants something. Sometimes she sits in my chair in my room for like 15 minutes after asking for what she wants(saying nothing btw) to prove she isn’t just “here for something.”

We were on the way somewhere in the car and it was dead quiet and she goes “Oh u/PrideAffectionate385” and I give her an amused look and she goes “why the face” and I jokingly respond saying “you only talk to me when you want something from me so how can I help you?” She immediately goes sour and today(the conversation happened last night) she was still bitter about what I said when she came to my room (to ask me for something shocker!!!) and made a super snide comment about it

AITA For Walking Out on My Mom and Brother While They Were Crying?,43,156r7zx,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156r7zx/aita_for_walking_out_on_my_mom_and_brother_while/,14,"For context I (22M) am a first-gen recent grad and come from a low-income, immigrant background. 

To begin, most of my life my dad has been an alcoholic and financially irresponsible.  As such, my parents had no concrete plan for me when it came to attending college, even though they assumed I’d go. Luckily, I was a good student in high school and got into an Ivy League, so they didn’t have to pay for my schooling (bc of generous fin aid). While I was in college, my dad was able to kick his alcoholism, but started spending the money that he would use for beer on useless things (too many clothes, unneeded furniture, shoes, etc.). Recently, this caused me to stress out bc my parents didn’t have enough money for my bro to go to a school he was interested in, so I realized I’d have to pitch in. However, I helped my family talk through things, and we decided that it would be best for him to attend a cheaper community college.

This caused me to start to worry more about their finances, so I asked my mom what their plans were for the future. She didn’t give much of an action plan, and said that they’d move to their home country and figure it out. I asked about savings and realized that they wouldn’t have anything after putting my bro thru school and even that was a stretch. I started freaking out because as had happened with my college and with helping my bro figure out some of his college stuff, I worried that I’d have to plan for their future—ie, saving and investing for them myself. 

So I asked my mom if they expected me to provide for them in the future, especially with my dad’s current spending habits. Although she first said no and told me not to worry, she eventually told me to “just assume you’ll have to and manage your finances that way.” I totally freaked out and told her that they should have told me before college so that I could’ve become a doctor or something more lucrative. Eventually, my mom said that they could just sell my grandfather’s home in their home country and live off that. Then I worried even more because to me, that didn’t sound like a very sustainable, or certain plan. 

So I got upset, and told her that it pissed me off to see them never having thought-out plans, and it’s not like my dad is doing much to prepare for the future. My mom started crying, and when I asked why, my bro, who had been in the room, started yelling at me, saying, “because you’re a fucking asshole! Worry about the now, you fucking asshole!” He started crying as well and went to console her. I walked out. 

I feel like my family is banking on things “just working out,” like my college, but they don’t see that it worked out bc I busted my ass, despite all the emotional trouble my dad put me thru at home. I also feel like my bro is taking for granted several instances where my planning helped him. I’m trying to plan rn so that he isn’t also stuck providing for my parents on a mediocre salary.

AITA for dropping out of my best friend’s wedding as the maid of honor?,6,15746il,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15746il/aita_for_dropping_out_of_my_best_friends_wedding/,13,"
I (17female) was best friends with Gracie (19female) for two years. It was the first real friendship I had and I loved her dearly. At the beginning of last year, she started dating John (22male) and things progressed quickly. 

They met through a dating app and went to the same high school but never knew each other. John is in the marines and is notorious for being a cheating asshole. When she first told me about the relationship I was so happy for her and supportive. I even started a friendship with John. 

They met for the first time 6 months into talking because John is stationed in Japan. In the months leading up, Gracie had told me every bad thing John has done and I kept it sorta neutral until they met. John treated Gracie like an after thought when planning things for his “welcome home trip” but then PROPOSED that same trip (without a ring I may add). 

The wedding was planned to happed in four months and as the plans progressed, John started to express his annoyance of me and Gracie was put into an awkward position. He was saying he didn’t trust me, thought I had feelings for Gracie, and said I was a whore. 
I started to become very vocal about how I didn’t like John and didn’t appreciate how he was treating my friend. 

It was establish I would be the maid of honor at the wedding. However 3 months before the ceremony Gracie quits taking to all braid-maids. After 3 weeks of ghosting she opens a up to me about feeling depressed and I told her that John better not f#ck up again and better not be the reason for her feeling this way. 

John texts me minutes later and we have a whole confrontation about how he treats Gracie and how I treat Gracie. John said very cruel and blind sided things to me. I decided then that I shouldn’t probably be in the weddings and that my friend was not the same anymore. 

COME TO FIND OUT through a mutual friend, Gracie was telling John what to say the whole time I was getting attacked for how I am a sh#t friend.

After a month of MULTIPLE attempts to reach out to Gracie and wanting to talk I was emotional drained. I told her I was not going to be in the wedding and wished her love and luck. I blocked her and was heartbroken We’ve never spoken since..

Almost a year later, I still think about if I overstepped in sharing my opinions about John during the wedding planning or if I was just trying to protect her. Am I the asshole for cutting contacting so quickly and dropping the wedding 2 months before the date?",1690084273.0
AITA for dancing with a stranger at a party my guy friend invited me to?,39,156rjtv,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156rjtv/aita_for_dancing_with_a_stranger_at_a_party_my/,41,"Jack (25M) and I (23F) have been friends for 2 months. Initially, he pursued me as a romantic partner and we drunkenly kissed a couple times but settled on being just friends (I told him i’m not looking for a relationship).

He invited me to go drinking with his friend group and when the bars closed, Jack, another friend Anthony, and I decide to go to an after party.

All 3 of us walk to the after party and get drinks/ start socializing with other people. I start talking to a guy next to the DJ booth and Jack comes up to me and says something snide about me flirting with other men. I walk away to find Anthony, and sit next to him on the couch.

Later on in the night, Anthony leaves and I get up from the couch and head to the bathroom. I pass by the small dance floor and see Jack dancing with a girl (like spinning her around). I didn’t think anything of it and after a couple minutes of waiting in line he comes up to me and asks me if i’ll get home safe. I said “of course, you don’t need to walk me home, I can do it myself”. He says he’ll walk me home at the end of the night and then I go to the bathroom.

I walk back to the small dance floor and don’t find Jack or Anthony. I sit down on a chair and start talking to a guy that was standing and dancing. We hit it off and he asked me to dance so I said yes. We danced and I throw it back on him on the dance floor and Jack saw,  came up to me and said he was leaving and to block his number and never talk to him again. I said OK, excused myself from my dance partner and head straight out the front door to walk home.

I walked about 15ft and Jack ran out and stopped me and said he can’t do this anymore, it hurts him to see me be with someone else and that he brought me to the party, and he expected bare minimum for me not to dance with other people. He gets that I’m single, but it still hurt his feelings.

I apologize and asked him if he wanted me to stay or leave, and he said “it’s not my party”. I asked again and he said he wanted me to stay and he knows that I am single I can do whatever I want but he expected for all 3 of us to hangout and not flirt with other people.

I truly don’t know what the solution is. I want to go out and have fun but am I supposed to not dance with any guy ever when we go out?

All 7 yrs have been hard on us cause our first 2 I was dealing with sister having incurable brain tumor & her passing in 2019. His mom had had a bad stroke & was completely bedridden also during this time and passed the following year. At the time he would be away at work (dredging) for 2 to 5 weeks & home for a week before returning back. I would drive him there (Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida, etc) to drive back to get him to just make the trip again the next week due to one vehicle. I never minded cause got to see new places. When we 1st meet though he was a truck driver and had been since he was 20. But about the time my sister passed we had saved enough and he was tired of always being away, that we bought his 1st semi of his own and he was thrilled. Problem come the next day. Just 2 months after sister & day after purchasing truck, a regular colonoscopy showed I had cancer. My husband decided to leave truck parked for 7 months while I went thru 2 surgeries (first leading to realization it had already spread to my liver) 4 hard chemo treatments (53 hrs--8 in office & 48 with pump at home) ( lost fingur & toe nails, was unable to to touch cold items, lost all my hair, day pump come off he was wheeling me in wheel chair cause so sick, messed my vision up), 2 more surgeries (which last on liver was during covid in jan 2020 & he was not allowed in hospital with me when I had) and then 8 more hard chemo. My chemo was every other week cause it took a week to recover it was so intense. When I started 8 though I told him let's ride cause was able to do chemo while on truck. I would do 8 hr office get pump and would head out to be back in 48 to get off. He never missed a beat or complained about having to take care of me. Year after started though I was in remission and have been since. He is now retired due to eye sight.

Here the part I may be ah. Since I am unable to deal with heat especially at night when trying to sleep after chemo stopped. I have air in house and ceiling fan but still not enough. So after soaking my hair down I also have 2 box fans going in bedroom each night to keep head comfortable enough to sleep. He is always saying he's feezing and I understand that, but I tell him he can put more clothes on or more blankets but I can't take more off cause already sleeping nude.  I get mad some nights hearing it so much I turn fans off but end up unable to sleep and very restless. At this time my son, his gf, stepson, and son live with us as they remodel house next door so unable to sleep in different rooms.

I am the only one who drives and am at university so usually have the most time and do the food shopping. Since I am on summer break I work full time waitressing which I am currently on a 9 day straight working long hours usually midday to 11pm. Both guys work Monday-Friday 9-5. On my days off I typically go get the shopping and just pay for it myself and even meal plan and get meals for what they have when I work late as when I work I don’t tend to eat dinner or I have it at work. Since I’m on this stretch we have come to the end of our last food for the weekly shop. Because of my working hours I have actually seen our friend in about a week. I have since got a message from them both saying what I’m planning on getting them for their dinners and when I’m planning on getting it. My next day off is in 5 days… I replied saying they’re both big enough to sort themselves out and get their own food. At the very least could do the shopping and have it delivered. They’ve said I am being inconsiderate and they’re both tight on money as they are going on holiday soon and had to pay for that and wasn’t expecting this expense. 

I appreciate they had to pay a lot for their holiday and they don’t expect to pay for their food as I get it and rarely ask for help with it however this week I’m particular I have very little free time due to work while I could go in the mornings I am reluctant to because I’ll have to pay for their food when I won’t eat any of it myself.

Paul and I have been very busy doing the project. Mark tries to help by asking me what he should do, but I don't know what can he do because Mark hardly attends classes, and when he does, he is either gaming or sleeping. 

One time when we worked on a presentation which Mark actually contributed,  his share of work was half assed and I had to redo his whole part, simply because there was no way that kind of work will be accepted by my lecturers.

My other classmates also share the same experience, mark wants to help in projects, but cant or produces unacceptable work to the group. Simply because he was inattentive in lessons. There are even times he doesn't know that there was a project or assignment.

I dont think its fair to not give Mark any work to do, then rate him a zero in the project's peer evaluation survey(the score given by the survey was about 10% of the final project score). But at the same time, he cant do much and sometimes probably slows down the project completion rate.

I respect the choice, and want them to do what feels right. The problem is that I self-medicate with marijuana in my free time. I don’t see a problem with my use, I use about once or twice a month for extremely bad period pains and anxiety. I have gone to the doctors many times, but they will not give me adequate pain relief despite me having endometriosis. So sometimes when I’ve used every over-the-counter medication possible, I smoke a small joint. My partner really doesn’t think that it’s moral for me to be using an illegal drug as pain relief.

Comparing to the last few years, I have made drastic changes in my use, going from smoking every day to a few times a month. They know this, but don’t seem to be very proud of my progress, because they want me to completely stop using. 

My partner is autistic(so am
i) , so they sometimes see things in black and white, and can not understand others choices. This is especially rigid when talking about drugs. They do not think using any drugs is moral, because it’s illegal. I’ve tried explaining myself for all of our relationship, but have not come to a conclusion.  My partner often doubts me and thinks my use will spiral thus causing a lot of anxiety for them.

These two new kids are both under 3, while my uncle’s daughter is 13 and my aunt’s son is 16.
Now the two younger ones are already (I apologize for the language) the most spoiled little brats ever, AT THREE YEARS OLD! Now I know that most parents like to spoil their babies, but this is crazy. I babysit them from time to time and I can’t even say the word no without them creating a whole chaos.
My uncle is trying his best to raise them to NOT be so spoiled, but any time he says no or just slightly scolds either of them, my aunt will step in and hug them and go “is daddy being mean? Well I’m here”, and scold HIM. 

Now with the other kids, especially my uncle’s daughter, she’s a whole other person. She constantly tells my cousin that she’s doing stuff wrong, that she’s annoying, etc.. you get it. Something she definitely doesn’t need from her only mother-figure as her own mom isn’t able to take care of her.

A couple of weeks ago we were having a family dinner, including aunts, uncles, cousins, etc..
After we had eaten, we sat in the living room talking and just having fun. A usual family evening. My sister and I were telling our cousin about how fast she’s grown and that we couldn’t believe she was already going to middle school. 
Our cousin told us about how  her clothes suddenly were to small. She said that pretty much all her clothes were a size Small, and that she thought she should start buying size Medium, no big deal, right? Well that’s when out aunt decided to but in.
“Nonono you’re already a size Medium at LEAST! We should start buying your clothes in Large”, she said out of nowhere. She wasn’t even included in the conversation!
Our cousin insisted that she was a size Small, but our aunt kept nagging, saying things like “it’s not weird noting how much you eat”, stuff like that. 
After a while i was fed up, i had defended my cousin the whole time, but she didn’t listen. 

So seeing it as the only was to stop her from dragging down my little cousins confidence, i told her to shut up and that nobody was interested in listening to her annoying voice literally bullying her own stepdaughter.

I met Luke when  Julia was a freshman so I was aware that he offered to pay her schooling for 6 years, that was their deal. Luke started his adulthood with a lot of debt from school and didn't want Julia to go through any of that, he only wanted her to focus on getting an education. His business was successful so he paid for her tuition, apartment, car note, food, and other expenses (gas money, phone bill, clothing allowance, etc). He has spent close to $300,000 in 6 years. 

Luke and I run our businesses together and we combined finances after getting married, his business generates 10-15% more revenue than mine. Four months ago we had a discussion with Julia and asked her what her plans were regarding her future after school, she said she wanted to stay near her friends so Luke helped her secure a position where the starting salary was in the low six figure range. We decided that we would give her a rental property so that she would not pay rent, she would only be responsible for the utilities. 

Six weeks ago Julia's plans changed. She quit her job and told us that she wants to continue her education in the UK- a second Master's Degree and her PHD after. She's expecting us to pay for it. Luke discussed it with me and I told him that she should take out a loan. He paid for 6 years of schooling, pulled strings to get her into her career of choice, and we gave her a free place to stay. I don't think it's fair that we pay another $200-300,000 for Julia to avoid working and not deal with responsibilities. Luke agrees but he's a bit of a pushover. I reminded Luke that we have shared finances and my business brings in almost just as much as his, therefore I also have a say in this. 

Julia has been complaining to her parents and all of our relatives that I am denying her a chance to ""succeed at life."" Luke's aunt says that it's only fair that we continue paying for her to attend university since Luke was the one who offered her a debt free education.

AITA for insisting my wife stop using the crushed ice setting that spits ice shards all over the floor?,6,15769od,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15769od/aita_for_insisting_my_wife_stop_using_the_crushed/,35,"Context:

We recently got a new fridge. Nothing too fancy, but for the first time in our 6 years together, we have a functioning ice machine. Only thing is the design isn’t ideal for dispensing crushed ice. Basically, it spews ice shards out to the point where a fair amount of it does not land in the cup, but down into the ice catcher and onto the floor in significant quantities to be an annoyance. It’s not just a few stray flakes that will quickly evaporate. To wit, the ice builds up and melts in the ice tray and eventually dribbles down the side of the fridge and pools on the floor along with the floor bound ice shards.

As a result, the floor in front of the fridge is constantly pooling wet, and the fridge door constantly looks dingy, streaky, and gross. I get tired of cleaning it up all the time. She cleans it up when she cleans the kitchen, but almost never cleans up on the spot. 

I’ve raised this minor annoyance to my wife several times and suggested to her that using cubed ice solves the issue. She has always simply said that she likes the crushed ice and wants to continue using it. Clearly the stray water and ice do not bother her as much as it does me.

I asked her again tonight, but a bit more pleadingly. I told her that it actually makes me unhappy; we struggle to keep the house clean as it is, I work from home long hours, and I don’t like constantly looking at this water mess and cleaning it up.  I didn’t accuse her of making the mess, I just simply asked if she’d be willing to make the switch for my sake.

Her response was to go quiet and into a distinct mood shift away from the cheerful atmosphere we had going. When I pressed her whether she acknowledged my issue, she admitted she wasn’t happy because “I don’t feel like I have a choice here but fine I’ll do it” and that she feels I’m issuing an ultimatum. 

I got pretty annoyed with this response because if the shoe were on the other foot, I’d happily change my choice of ice preference to accommodate her need to not constantly step in melted ice within two feet of the fridge. I didn’t approach this with the intent of wrenching concessions from her, I didn’t want to “win”. I just wanted her to see how this was affecting me and make a very small compromise that would make both our lives a little easier.

Alas, we literally went to bed angry over this. But maybe I am issuing an ultimatum here, maybe she’s right to feel imposed upon. But the ice drives me crazy, and I would genuinely experience real relief if she would willingly change this one, seemingly insignificant habit. So, who is the asshole here?",1690091008.0

I asked if he can skip the gender reveal and opt to celebrate his fiancée’s birthday instead (as originally planned) but he said he already RSVP. 

I told him it’s fine we don’t have to celebrate anyway since a) He wouldn’t budge b) My birthday is in July not August. This has caused a rift in my relationship because he thinks I’m being immature. Reddit AITA?",1690079107.0
AITA for asking my mom not to come with me while I recieve a breast ultrasound?,3,1577j8e,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1577j8e/aita_for_asking_my_mom_not_to_come_with_me_while/,12,"I (29F) went to do an ultrasound breast screening this week at a charity clinic.

Some background information: my mother is a breast cancer survivor and was very anxious about what was going on. I totally acknowledge this and did not plan on hiding any results from her whatsoever. 

However, I asked that I go into the room by myself so that I have the oppprtunity to see what is going on and if needed, hear any bad news and try process it alone. My mother immediately gets upset and asks why she can't come, saying that I wouldn't know what I'm looking at and wouldn't know what follow up questions to ask. I explain my reasoning and say that she can always ask the doctors for more information or give them her questions if needed after the appointment is done. She retorts saying that ""asking the doctors to explain gain would be incredibly rude"" as this is a charity clinic. She is clearly upset and goes to the car. 

A few minutes later my father asks me to come outside and tries to convince me to let my mother come with me. Feeling tired, I relent and tell him to convey this to her. 

When its time for my appointment I go looking for her, and tell her she has about 10 seconds to come as the appointment starts NOW and I shouldn't be looking for her.

As I get to the room and get the doctors' instructions, she comes to the door and the assistant asks if she wants to come in. Instead of doing so, she tearfully says ""No, no my daughter doesn't want me in there."" The assistant awkwardly closes the door. 

At this point I've had it. I didn't ask anyone to bar her, I had to go looking for her and now this. I was not going to beg her to come inside, as the appointment is being delayed. 

One of the doctors notices what's going on and asks if I don't want my mom to be with me during the appointment. I explain that I'd like to receive the results alone. 

The scan finishes & all is fine. I ask the doctors my follow up questions and free of worry. 

I go outside and the doctors see my mother and assure her everything is fine, I just need to do my yearly scans from now on. 

For the rest of the day and continuing, my mother refuses to speak to me and tells me that I should ""do whatever I want"" since I clearly don't need her. I get pissed this morning and confront her only to be told that ""I have hurt her deeply."" and she doesn't want to speak to me anymore. 

I understand that she was worried and her battle with cancer was not easy at all. But at this point I suspect that whatever feelings she has had about the process are being projected onto me and by asking her not to come into the scan room, my mom thinks I have rejecting & downplaying her struggle against cancer. She has refused to see a therapist for this or any other emotional problems and I don't know what to do. 

Personally, I feel like my own health scare has actually become all about her.

He works tuesday - sunday, and i understand if we can't go on dates if he has work. I also understand if he wants to do sports after work. But even now on his off day he plays basketball, and our date just cut short as formality before he goes back to his exciting activity.

She asked why, and he goes on to explain that one of his brothers had outed him to his parents for being bisexual. He felt powerless and felt like whenever he says things to his parents, they're powerless.

He was questionable at first, because I don't normally check in on him at random times, then he said to me the same thing that he said to my best friend. Him and I call because I made him feel better, and I tell him to get his brother on the phone.

He does so, and I start yelling at him for outing him to his parents without his permission, and or without waiting for him to actually come out to his parents on his own time. When I was yelling at him, I asked ""How and why did you stoop so low?"", ""Why couldn't you wait?"", and ""Would you like it if he did that to you?"". His brother was speechless, and didn't say a word for what felt like hours on end.

Sometimes you hear people pressuring you to do something and hitting in your soft spots and you start to wonder.  For fun I sent this to my mom and she told me that she could have easily told me that not being an all expenses paid vacation home didn’t make us assholes 😂***

*edit #2. My mom wanted me to add a note because she said she was very touched by many people’s concerns about the cousin and her family staying with her. Thanks to all the kind people out there.   She wanted me to clarify that it’s a guest suite in her condo that people who live there can rent for guests. Basically the cousin was getting a free hotel room. **

I(41F) and my husband (44M) have had a really hard year.  We both had to switch jobs over the course of the year and our daughter (14F) has struggled significantly with her mental health.  Our son (12M) plays baseball on a travel team and we have struggled to take care of our daughter and not let our son down in the process.  We live in a big city where cost of living is high, and so is travelling here as a tourist.  
2 weeks ago my husband’s aunt called my MIL (60s?) and informed her that his cousin (35F) and her three kids (2M, 6F, 10F) was coming to stay with us for 3 days in the big city.  At the end of the 3 days his aunt would pick them up and take them to her place to have a couple weeks at grandmas house. Basically his cousin has had a lot going on and she deserves a vacation so she was coming to our place where we could help with the 3 kids and she could be a tourist and relax.  We are supposed to pick her and the kids at the train station and take them to our place from there. 

My Husband and I were informed of all of this along with the fact that we would be hosting 2 family dinners during that time.  

To say I was livid would have been the understatement of the year.  The 3 days she is here are weekdays when both my husband and I have to work, my daughter has a therapy session, and my son has a game in a city an hour away.  

When my husband and I said ummm no.  We were told by his family we are being unreasonable. So we arranged for her to have a guest room in my moms condo about a 10 minute drive away so she and the kids had a place to stay.  This set off his side of the family again because it made her feel unwelcome.  Mind you we had tried to reach out to the cousin directly repeatedly since her mom (husband’s aunt) informed us of the plans. She won’t answer texts or emails.  Every time we reach out his aunt calls us back and guilts us. 

His family thinks we are not being welcoming and should help this poor lady with so many kids out and let her have a 3 day vacation. She doesn’t have a lot of money and this would be the only way for her to stay in the city.

But all of a sudden a boy yelled out to the teacher that she wouldn't have a job if none of us went to that class, and this was while she was trying to calm us down.

All of a sudden everyone looked at me, like I had said it. The teacher started scolding me, and I was really confused. This evidently made her more upset, and when I started to try and tell her that it wasn't me, she threatened to call my parents.

No one was listening to the fact that I didn't say it, and the boy who said it didn't say anything. In the end, she still told my parents.

I ended up being forced to rewrite a reflection 3 times over because it wasn't satisfactory, and people got mad whenever I tried defend myself in these reflections. 

In the end, I ended up cursing out my classmate who had said it online, calling them a bunch of names, but no slurs, constantly telling them to 'f*ck off' and how the world would be better without him.

Considering the cost of the debut and how many months my parents would struggle financially, I chose the gift instead.

I told them in the email that he had died and would want them all to know, and that I would follow up with information about funeral arrangements when they were finalized. 

On Thursday, in between writing the obituary, notifying relatives, dealing with insurance companies, etc. (not to mention dealing with my regular life, which includes having a one-year-old daughter), my sisters and I met with the funeral home and scheduled services for late afternoon/early evening on Saturday. 

The obituary, with information about services, was posted Thursday afternoon on the funeral home's website and on social media. I did not follow up with an email to his colleagues. 

Saturday (the day of the funeral) I woke up to an email from one of my dad's colleagues, asking about services. I responded with details and an apology for not following up. Then I saw that the same colleague had sent the following email to everyone else, including my dad, 15 minutes after he had emailed me but before I had replied:

""I did not hear back from xxxxx.  I inquired this morning.  I then did a funeral home search and found xxxxx’s obituary.  He is at xxxx.  It is today, from xxxxxx.  The obit is online.  I am quite chagrined by the late notice.""

1:Staying up late makes you gain weight 
2:you have no energy and take naps
My reasoning were:
1: I have not gain nor loss weight do to lack of exercise which I wish to improve on

3: I do my chores, wake up at the time they want me to, I don’t do drugs or sneak out

Yes I know I should be helpful towards my sister and that she's done a lot for me but i'm just so done with her guilting me or pawning her dog off on me because it's exhausting. 

So WIBTAH if I told my sister i'm not her personal dog sitter?


Update: For anyone who reads this and saw my original earlier thank you, and thank you to everyone for the advice as well. This is going to be a long edit sorry for that in advance, i'll put a TLDR after this edit in case you don't want to read :) 

To start off, here is some info about the dog: 
He is a Rottweiler, he's not mixed with anything. I thought he was but nope.. my bad. He's not house trained at all but I was working on it. My sister coddles him so all he knows is ""he gets what he wants when he wants it"" and ""any place is free game for a bathroom"" Which is NOT okay! I was trying to teach him all that I can and I thought he was somewhat getting there, but as soon as I started making progress my sister screwed it all up. I'm only 5'2 and 95 pounds so the older and stronger this dog gets the worse it will be for me since I am quite possibly the weakest person in this entire world lol. 

I took everything into account and called my sister a couple hours ago. I thought I should just get it over with and say what I need to say before I talk myself out of it. I'm a very shy and timid person when it comes to confrontation. If I can, I avoid it at all costs. With that being said, I told her straight up that I will not be dog sitting for her anymore. I didn't think it was fair to me or the dog to be treated that way. I looked up daycares, trainers and dog walkers. I did a lot of research on each of them and told her everything I found and gave her all their contact information. I also said that I know you might be tight for money but $10 a week? I asked her if she was willing to raise it, I would appreciate it very much. Then ended with saying I loved her, but I wasn't going to be bossed around anymore or used as a doormat and I would also really appreciate if she could treat me with a little more respect. After I said all that it was like hell blew over. She told me that I was a selfish brat for not wanting to help her out, that this is the least I could do for her. She also said that she never gets to ""live life"" and that i'm holding her back from being happy. What about the raise in money you ask? She said ""If you think you are getting any more money you are delusional! I have no more money to give you!"" that's about where our conversation ended. She hung up and called our parents to tell them I wasn't helping her out at all and I was being a selfish brat. And what did my parents do, took her side and grounded me. So there's that. 

And to end it, I will say I was more than willing to help my sister out in emergency situations like hospital visits or if she had anything major going on. I was 100% there and willing to help however, that all turned into a slippery slope. I know I should stand up for myself I just hate to cause any tension or anger so I always just go with it. But now I see that has made me everyone's doormat and i'm not okay with that. Anyways, i'm just looking after my sisters dog for 1 more week till she's back then i'm done. I can't take the dog anywhere since I don't have the money for that and I obviously can't just leave him alone because that's cruel. I'm obviously upset about the outcome of the situation but it's okay, i'll get over it and hopefully we can move past this situation. 

TLDR: I told my sister I wasn't going to care for her dog anymore and I won't be pushed around. She told my parents and now i'm grounded because i'm a selfish person for not wanting to help out.",1690030862.0

We have two children of our own, both girls, aged 5 and 2. I also have a son (10) from a previous marriage, but I was widowed.

My husband's ex is barely involved in stepson's life at all. They got divorced when stepson was 2, and his ex wanted ""a fresh start"" so my husband did the decent selfless thing and had complete custody of their son, even though he'd wanted shared custody.

I got a bonus at work and I really want to go on vacation with just MY family JUST once. We've been on family vacations all together lots of times. But just once I want to spend MY money going on vacation where I'm not looking after someone else's kid. I want stepson to stay with his mom while we go on vacation. My husband sees my point of view and is okay with it. I don't think I'm being at all unreasonable.

My mom found out what I was planning and says I'm being a complete AH. These are the reasons she says I could be the AH:

1. My mom says that if stepson's mom isn't properly involved in his life, I should be even more involved in his life to compensate (I think this is a completely unfair expectation).
2. She also says that I'm being a hypocrite taking my son, but I think that's totally different because my son DOESN'T HAVE ANOTHER PARENT. I'm all he's got.

If stepson's mom won't take him just for once then obviously he'll come on vacation with us. But I don't think I'm the AH to ask if I can have a vacation with my own family just one time. It's not like I hate stepson or something, he's a nice kid, he's just not mine. Am I the AH?

UPDATE:

We definitely won't be going on vacation without stepson.  


After a couple hours of replies, I decided to show this to my husband. We sat down and had a really long talk about it. He told me he's never been comfortable with my attitude to stepson, but didn't know how to say to me before.  
  
I don't want to be a bad person, I just never thought of stepchildren being ""yours"". I don't think it would be easy for anyone to accept this level of criticism, but all your replies have shown me I have a LOT of work to do. As many of you suggested (and so did my husband) I intend to see a therapist to help me with that. As I said, I don't hate stepson in any way, I have never been deliberately cruel to him, I've just always thought of him as my husband's child. But I realize my mindset needs to change.

So I'm going to start working on that. I want my family to be the best it can be, and I need to accept that it includes my stepson. I understand that now, and I'm going to start seeing a therapist to become a better person (we've also talked about maybe having family therapy too). I've also made up with my mom, and she is 100% behind the changes I want to make in my life.  
  
It wasn't easy to hear everything you said, but I understand that I needed to hear it.",1689954213.0

I work 14 days in a row for 12 hours a day. On the last day I actually only work 6 but they pay us for the full day on the day we fly home. 

I earn pretty good money and I like to enjoy my days off. My wife 32 on the other hand is a teacher. And for whatever reason she feels the need to stay busy. 

Before we got married I had a cleaning lady and I had a meal prep service for the days I didn't just eat out. I would also take a mini vacation every other week off. For example I would fly home Thursday, see my parents on Friday, then go to Vegas until Tuesday then fly back to work Thursday. 

When we got married I tried to keep my cleaning service but I was convinced it was a waste since she would be home those two weeks and she would keep the house tidy. 

I agreed. But it didn't turn out that way. She would leave some chores for me. Which is fine. Before I started living on my own I had to do cleaning and cooking and laundry at my parents home.  

But it started being more and more. Then we had kids and now it's even more. 

My wife chose to stay home with the kids. Which once again is fine. We can afford it and once both kids are in school next fall she is going back to work. 

The problem is that my kids are tiny little terrorists. They can walk into a clean living room and walk out five minutes later leaving it a crime scene.  

I would be coming home to a mess. No bueno. So I hired a service to clean. ALL THE TIME. Not just for when I'm home. And I got one of the meal delivery services for three meals a week while I'm gone and four when I'm in town. I cook the other two meals. And I do the dishes. Well I put the dishes in the machine and put them way afterwards. 

My wife keeps saying that I should be doing all that work and that I'm kind of an asshole for throwing money at my chores instead of doing them myself. But she also looks less exhausted and is happier. I'm also happier not having to clean up after myself and the three of them. 

I still do all the yard work when I'm home, which is minor because my service does the mowing and stuff while I'm gone. 

So am I the asshole for paying someone to do my chores instead of doing them myself.",1690027553.0
AITA for getting mad at my friends over them going to the cinema without me?,1,157d71m,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157d71m/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_friends_over_them/,22,"Okay, it might sound a bit bad, but let me explain.


ALSO, MY ENGLISH SUCKS, BECAUSE I’M NOT A NATIVE SPEAKER, SORRY! 


I (15F) have a group of friends (all girls of 15-16F). We have a group chat, in which we regularly speak.Three weeks ago, on a Thursday, we were talking about the new LadyBug movie and how they all wanted to go. I never really was a fan of the show, so I told them “Oh, okay, but I’m not into that show.”I have two nieces, 6F and 8F, who love LadyBug. I eventually told them I had planned to watch the movie with my nieces. They asked me if I didn’t mind watching it, and I told them that the places were already bought. So, why not ?

The next week, on Monday, I see all of them over social media in a cinema, in which they say that they went to watch, what? LadyBug, of course. All of this without me. I got mad, not because they watched the movie, but because they never include me in their plans. It’s not the first time that it has happened to me with them, being excluded from their plans. And sometimes it’s not even because we don’t have the same interests. I don’t even know why.


So, I confronted them. And they used the excuse “Oh but you told us you didn’t like LadyBug, so we thought it was useless to ask you to come with us. And also, you’re gonna watch it with your niece. Why watch it twice?” When they knew I would’ve watched it first with them, as they went on Monday and I was going to watch it with my nieces on Sunday.

Okay, but the simple thought of asking me, just per curiosity, never crossed your mind? Maybe I would’ve said yes, because even if I disliked the movie, at least we would’ve had a great moment together.


They didn’t understand why I got mad, but my sister and mother stood up by my side and understood why I was upset. It’s not about you going, it’s about you never including me. I feel like I’m not even their friends. Because like I said, it has happened so many times before, but I would go back to them and forgive them. But I don’t care anymore, I went to another school district and I’m much more happier with a new friendgroup at school.

So, AITA? Did I overreact? I want to act in a mature way, because I haven’t addressed the situation with them since.


EDIT: Okay, I think it’s clear for you that I’m the asshole, and that some of you think that I want them to stroke my ego. It’s not about that. I was just worried that the processus of me being excluded all over again. Thank you for those who gave me some advices. I will be deleting the post soon, because I got the answer to my question. Thank you again.😊",1690114086.0
WIBTA for contacting my SB’s mom for not giving me an account name?,2,157939v,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157939v/wibta_for_contacting_my_sbs_mom_for_not_giving_me/,13,"
i (18F) have a step brother (15M) we’ll call him A who has a boyfriend (18M) who we’ll call P.

I started a NSFW twitter page about 4 months ago, and i have gained a decent following on that page, so i have some traction. 

the topic of my page came up in conversation on the phone with A about 2 days ago. for context, the discussion of my account was short and i didn’t think much of it until today. 

at about midnight, A texted me demanding to know my twitter handle as he thought his boyfriend may have been following me and that P had shown some of my content to him. I freaked out and immediately gave him my account because i was uncomfortable with the thought of A’s boyfriend having access to it. 

I was told that he wasn’t following me and i thought that was the end of it, but P then said that he had seen my page before and then started making comments on my body. A told him to go inside but he instead took the phone from A and proceeded to talk to me. 

He looked over at A, back at me, and then said, “I don’t mean to sound like an asshole right now but i scrolled through OP’s media”

A was understandably upset, and told P once again to go inside, and he once again did not listen. P then looked at A and said, “i don’t see what the big deal is, it’s just another pair of tits to me.” to which A responded, “well it’s my SISTER’S body.”

At that point A muted the microphone, they hugged and talked for about 30 seconds and then A unmuted and said “we made up.”

i hung up after and immediately got another text from A asking to call back.
I immediately started yelling at them both.  A interrupted me saying “it was just a joke”

i asked if the whole thing was a joke and he said “no, just him following you.” it was at this time that i was told that not only did P look through my profile, but he followed me and unfollowed me as a “joke”. 

I started calling them disgusting and creepy for doing this to me and then A hung up the phone because he “couldn’t do it anymore.”

i then started texting him, and i will give the conversation summary:

i told A to not run from the conversation. P took the phone and started apologizing saying that he just has a “bad sense of humor” and then trying to chalk it down to a “misunderstanding” of the content i post. i called bullshit and demanded A to give me P’s twitter handle so i could be sure he couldn’t access my page. A refused to give me the handle, saying “Im sorry I can't give you that, I care for you both”. 

i then gave A am ultimatum, either he gives me the handle, or i would call his mom and explain the situation to her. I was then called manipulative. 

I asked one more time for the handle, A refused, so i informed him that i would be calling his mom and i no longer considered him family, at which point i was blocked. 

so my question is, would i be the AH if i followed through and called A’s mom knowing the positing it may put him in?",1690100539.0
AITA for ruining my brother's surprise?,20,156tfcq,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156tfcq/aita_for_ruining_my_brothers_surprise/,10,"I (17m) am currently living with my brother, Tom (23m, fake name) and his girlfriend, Steph (22f, also fake name) for the summer. He lives in the city about two hours away from our big family that has always lived close to each other and works a really great job in his field. His gf and I really get along and it's been a chill summer, except for my brother has been going through a rough time with his job that he says will get easier once he gets through it. But he's been very stressed and Steph and I have been doing what we can do make his life easier.

Our family growing up was always big on surprises; every announcement, gift, party, etc was a surprise. We even went to a couple surprise weddings. After a while it stops being a surprise when you expect a surprise. But ruining a surprise results in a bunch of family getting mad at the spoiler.

Since it's been a year since my brother moved to the city, my family wanted to throw a surprise party at his place with the help of Steph and me, and they've put a lot of pressure on us to make it special and keep it a secret. I know it's been hard on Steph cause she told me she hates keeping secrets from Tom, so I had been doing most of the preparation.

When his birthday came and I drove to pick Tom up from work, he told me how tired he was and how he just wanted to get home. I asked him if he wanted to do anything for his birthday and he said he just wanted to chill with Steph and me and watch movies until we pass out. When we stopped for gas I called my family and told them to leave everything and maybe a note for Tom cause he was not up for a party right now, but my parents insisted I get him there on time and that he'd be happy to see everyone. There was about 20 people there waiting for him with presents and food.

Well, when I got in the car, I told him our family was waiting for him back at his place. He didn't even react and just told me to drive up to this bar about a block from his place. We were there for over an hour and he downed a couple of drinks before we left for the party. 

We got there and he acted happy to see everyone, but I could tell our parents were mad about us being late. Steph took me aside and quietly asked me why we were late and I guess my dad overheard me explaining where we were and why. The party lasted about five hours before everyone left, but my parents stayed behind to yell at me for ruining the surprise for my brother. 

Since then, I've gotten a lot of texts from family members saying that I ruined the surprise and they could tell my brother was disappointed. My parents have pretty much implied that because of this to not expect my next birthday to be as special as my brother's was supposed to be. Steph and Tom haven't really said anything about it other than he doesn't blame us for getting pressured by our family.

AITA?

I was surprised with Carlie asked me to be a bridesmaid because growing up we weren't really that close because of the age gap, but I'm happy she thought of me and am willing to do it, even though I don't love weddings.

As the wedding gets closer, Carlie's bridesmaids chat (Lisa has her own group of bridesmaids) is filled. Every. Single. Day. with some update or question that we're expected to reply to. I hate texting, and I usually just try to give a thumbs up reaction to the texts so I'm not seen as rude but I don't have to spend hours replying every day. Carlie also texts me frequently outside of the groupchat about the wedding, and I'll admit I have a bad habit of leaving those on read. I guess I let some texts pile up, because Carlie messaged me last night and asked if we could talk about bridesmaid duties and basically insinuated that I shouldn't be a bridesmaid anymore because I'm ignoring her texts. I told her that that wasn't my intention but that she kept asking too many questions and that it wasn't possible to keep up and that I didn't want to share some information in the groupchat. She said that I could always talk to her separately and I told her that some things I just didn't want to share with her, and that's when she got mad. She said that she's tried to text me about things other than the wedding but that I ignore those too. This is partially true, but I just don't like texting in general and I am a private person. We got into a huge argument and now I don't know if I want to go to the wedding at all.

AITA?

EDIT: Okay, thank you for the feedback. I will let Carlie know that I am happy for her but not up to help her plan the wedding, I didn't realize that was an expectation when I said yes. I will ask if she wants me as a symbolic bridesmaid who shows up day-of in the outfit, or if she wants me to sit in the audience and not use the title. Thanks.",1690086695.0

My brother and SIL occasionally leave their toddler with us for babysitting, and two weeks ago, they dropped her off to go to a nearby bar, as they do about every 4 to 6 weeks.

I suspected that they drive after drinking, and I wanted to address the issue. Drunk driving is bad in general, of course, but I couldn't take the thought of something happening to my niece that I could have prevented but never said anything about. I decided that I *had* to say something. When they returned from the bar, I casually asked about their drinks, and my SIL said they had several cocktails. I also asked about their bus, which they have taken to get home before. However, they seemed evasive.

Later, I heard from my mom that they left in their car and that my brother even swayed before leaving. I texted my SIL about it, making sure to voice my concerns as neutrally a possible, but she denied it and became defensive. I emphasized that I only cared about their safety and not her reaction.

Despite this, my SIL blocked me. Now whenever they bring my niece over, she avoids me. She also plans on excluding me from an activity with my sisters even after one of them asked about me several times. This has led me to question if I might be in the wrong.

While I obviously could have directly confronted my brother, I consciously chose to talk to my SIL. My brother is quick to get angry and has reacted to confrontation by verbally abusing me, keeping my niece away from me and threatening me with physical violence before. I also believed she would be willing to prioritize her child's safety -  she has confronted my brother about much smaller things than drunk driving before. And I do believe she shares some responsibility in ensuring their daughter's safety, even if she wasn't driving. 

My SIL's extreme reaction has me questioning if I'm the bad guy here. AITA?",1690077984.0
AITA For suggesting to my friends that we go to a casino that was closer.

My best friend suggested we go to one that was like 25 miles away. I said it’s too far and too late so let’s go to one that was like 12 miles away. There were 4 of us hanging out and the topic had been brought up a few times before we decided to leave. 

My best friend had suggested going to the further one like 3 times throughout the conversation. We ultimately decided to go to the closer one and all agreed on it. It was also like 12:30 am. None of us had ever been to the closer one but the pictures and reviews looked not bad. When we got there it wasn’t as big or as nice as we thought and we ended up not playing really at all and just kinda leaving after some drinks. My best friend then proceeds to get mad at me for making us go to the small one claiming he was adamant about going to the further one because he knew it was way nicer. 

Keep in mind all he did was suggest we go there. I said that we all agreed to go here and we just got unlucky cuz we’ve never been here and it’s not my fault, how was I supposed to know u wanted to go to to the further one that badly? He then said because of how many times he suggested it he implied that it was a lot nicer and was gonna be much more fun than the other one. 

So I asked why didn’t u say that and just let us go the the closer one? He then said it’s because I’m the one who’s visiting so we should do what I want to do. I tried to explain that I don’t live here anymore and don’t know the places as well as he does, so if I’m saying we go somewhere and you know for a fact this other place is way better then say that don’t just let me drive blind. 

Also that I just searched for the closest casinos and suggested the closest one. We got into a pretty big argument and it ended with him saying he feels like he’s babysitting me because I’d been staying at his house. He said that he provided the food and cleaned the dishes from the previous 2 days. 

We had literally both just put them in the sink he just washed them a day later. 

Edit: Not only that, when he was washing the dishes I asked if he wanted help and he said nah he’ll do it this round.  

I said that’s part of inviting someone (especially your best friend) to stay with you, if we’re gonna be at your house we’re probably gonna be eating the food you have. He didn’t get it and asked what value I brought with me to his house. 

I said it’s not a thing of value it’s that Im visiting to see people and have fun like why did you offer to host me if you’re just expecting me to bring all my own food and add “value” to your house. He said it’s a thing of respect in his culture and I wouldn’t get it because I’m white. 

That was actually one of the craziest things I’d ever heard so I left and went back home right then. Now personally when I invite people to my house especially to stay a few days it’s heavily implied that I’m going to be sharing my food and living space with them. 

To me it’s not “babysitting” it’s called having class and being a good friend. I’d like to know if I was the asshole for just leaving and cutting the planned trip short after hearing that.",1690099166.0
AITA I don't want my grandmother at my wedding,22,156supi,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156supi/aita_i_dont_want_my_grandmother_at_my_wedding/,28,"So I am getting married in a year and I do not want to invite my grandmother (Cheryl). It's my fathers mom and he wants her to be invited. I love him very much and don’t want to hurt him. Firstly she’s hardly been in my life, she can't even spell my sisters name right (after 27 yrs, it's 4 letters), is SO rude to my mom and just generally sucks. 

  
The first thing Cheryl EVER said to my mom was ""if you guys have kids I won't be looking after them, I'm no babysitter."" So yeah.. when her husband (my paternal grandfather) died when I was 7 years old, she only showed up to holidays/birthdays moving forward. Except the one year that she was too busy with her friends at A&W to come to my birthday.

  
My dad had a massive heart attack resulting in a quadruple bypass surgery when I was 14 years old. He almost died and had to be transported from our local hospital to a cardiologist in a nearby bigger city (4hr drive). Cheryl never visited him at the hospital in or out of town. She also did not visit or help care for me and my sister when my parents needed to be in another city for the surgery and recovery.   
She sent a Christmas card to my cousin and her children's house that was addressed to the ""smith family"". When they opened the card it was to her abusive ex-husband only, wishing him a Merry Christmas. She had already been made aware of the abuse and the fact that he no longer lives there. (Cheryl's relationship with all her grandchildren sucks) 

  
My uncle (her favourite son, out of three) passed away recently. Her reaction to the news was ""I will miss seeing him around but I have someone else to care for my lawn already."" My mother and father were there to witness this. She didn't cry a single tear and literally was laughing during a part of his burial when people were asked to be silent. I saw her talking with a nearby friend and they both laughed but her laugh was so obnoxious my cousins (who were literally at their dads burial) just looked disgusted and hurt. Her behaviour is so appalling, my father was the only person at the burial in our immediate family to even speak to her. 

  
I am honestly so tired of this woman. I cannot stand her. I do not want her at my wedding. She has literally never been in my life and was still invited (for my dad) but in light of recent events I have made it clear that she is no longer on the list. The invitations haven't gone out yet. My mother, sister, and cousins all understand and support my decision but my mom also thinks that it would hurt my dad, and I should be considering his feelings. I still don't want her there, and I don't care if her sister (my great-aunt) doesn't come either. The less the merrier when it comes to Cheryl. 

  
I should add that I spoke with my cousin regarding her comfort level with Cheryl since the incident with Christmas card and as far as she is concerned, Cheryl is dead to her. She is not comfortable around her and would prefer to not be exposed to her.

  
So I ask you guys, Am I the asshole?",1690053926.0

Then he asks what I need help with and I said I was fine since I caught the hint and he said something that ended with “…with your mentally challenged friends.” So I was like okay cool. So I get my food, go to the table people are sitting at, and sit on the floor behind his brother. I was told I don’t have to sit on the floor but told them I preferred it down there. So I ask his brother his favorite song and play some music. He shows me a song. Then I say I have another question. I ask him “How many baby mommas do you have?” He looks at me blankly, sthen turns to the girl (who I later found out was his girlfriend) and tells her “guess what he just asked me” and he tells her what I said and she says “oh”. His brother then answers “I have one.” Then the girl asks me “how many baby mommas do you have?”. I said “none at the moment” and then stopped talking. His brother asked why I would say something like that, and I tell him it’s “something someone mentally challenged would do, right?” Then he says hesitantly “…no, I don’t think so.” Eventually he asks if that’s what I was upset about and I say yes and he says it’s because “he was drinking” and to not take it seriously, which I think was nonsense.

My brother, however, has zero self control.

That said, I was visiting my brother and SIL. I had probably one, maybe two, drinks and wasn’t remotely drunk but when we were all getting ready for bed My brother came in, clearly drunk, and chose that time to pitch a fit because I moved a chair so the blow up bed could be next to the wall plug for my phone (makes sense, right?) well apparently he disagreed. 

He started yelling and my mom responded by getting between us. He said I was a loser and a mooch because I lived with our parents, (Side note: I had no choice but to move back after my divorce and currently had a job and paid the bills I had, phone, car, etc.) He told me I should grow up or I would never amount to anything.

That’s when I unleashed and said he was just a drunken loser who gets wasted and is mean to his wife and neglects his kids. So he pointed out my drinking and I admitted I had been but that I had a clear enough mind to point out his hypocrisy and call him on his shit when no one else will.

He hits walls and calls his wife fat then sleeps all day while she does everything for the kids and house. She had been quiet the whole time which in retrospect her not wanting to get involved and add to the drama made sense. 

Eventually I left and had to take meds to stop a panic attack. My mom told him he was wrong and he eventually came outside and offered a “peace offering” by handing me a cigarette, I don’t smoke and told him I didn’t want it, I wanted an apology.

Around Christmas my mom almost had me convinced to go to visit for the holiday and I had some really great gifts for my nieces, whom I adore, and wanted to see their faces when they opened them. Not long before I messaged my SIL about something for the girls. She was asleep so naturally my drunk brother and decided to answer. He admittied it was him and said “I’m not gonna apologise for what I think is true but you’re still welcome in my home.” 

At that point I plainly told him to go fuck himself and blocked him across the board, then I decided I wasn’t going and even picked up a shift at work so I couldn’t change my mind.

My mom wanted me to let it go to “keep the peace” and that he was drunk and didn’t mean it but when you’re drinking you stop listening to your inner filter and the truth comes out.

My dad told me I was just being immature and should stop acting like this. Naturally, I was hurt that no one was on my side and always made excuses for him when I was held responsible for my actions. 

I didn’t go to Christmas and was sad because I only got to see pictures of my nieces opening their presents. 

Since then we managed to VERY slowly repair our relationship but this really sticks with you even after you’ve forgiven them. 

So AITA for not “keeping the peace”?",1690061573.0
AITA for naming my child after my deceased uncle?,8,156xu36,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156xu36/aita_for_naming_my_child_after_my_deceased_uncle/,17,"I (24F) am currently 7 months pregnant. My husband (25M) and I decided to give our son my uncle’s middle name. For context, my uncle and I were extremely close, he was a second father to me and supported me when the majority of my family wouldn’t even speak to me. He passed when I was 16, after he battled with depression for years. It absolutely shattered me. My husband and I met in high school, shortly after my uncle had passed. They never met, but my husband knows the impact it had on me. When I found out I was going to have a boy, I wanted to use my uncle’s middle name. His middle name “R” will also be my son’s middle name. 

I talked to my cousins (his children, 17F and 14B) and they said that they loved it. AFTER getting their blessings, we announced his official name to the rest of the family. This is when my aunt (49F) called me. Absolutely livid. Screaming about how I didn’t consult her. Mind you, my aunt and uncle had been separated for over 3 years and were in the process of a divorce when he died. A lot of my family blames her. I don’t, but I understand where they’re coming from. She had also been in a different relationship during the last year of his life. I told her that I was sorry, but asked why she was so upset because I had cleared it with her children first. She said because SHE could want to use the name. 
I might’ve been TA because I told her that she doesn’t own his name and that I’m his family just as much as she is. I loved my uncle dearly and I just want to honor him with my child. AITA?

WIBTA for not calling grandma on her bday?,3,1575vhd,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1575vhd/wibta_for_not_calling_grandma_on_her_bday/,9,"First time posting and on my phone, sorry in advance for whatever. 

I understand that context is obviously needed here, but some details will be withheld to protect my children. 

I (40F) have 4 children (11F, 9M, 2M, 1F). The babie's aunt just notified me that it was the babie's paternal grandmother's birthday tomorrow. Aunt explained that gma hasn't been feeling herself lately, and thought that if the babies called to say happy birthday, it would cheer her up.

So here's why I was wondering if I WBTA  for not calling. Since I left her son, she has not gone out of her way to contact myself or my children. I tried to maintain a civil relationship with gma for the sake of the kids. However, once I realized it was one-way, I stopped unless absolutely necessary. 

What I mean by one-way: She never called on any holidays or birthdays to speak to her grandchildren, no presents sent either. She even had to ask me when my youngest's bday was. Gma is only in her early 50's (I think 52nd bday), and does not have any form of dementia. She has 5 grandkids total so not too many bdays to lose track of. My 1yo is her youngest grandchild and was a preemie so pretty unforgettable birth. 

I also feel that this needs noted as it's a big part of the backstory. Gma's son (sperm donor) also has no contact with my kids. The reason for that is because he legally is not allowed around children for 5 years as part of his parole. I have a restraining order against him as well, for myself and the children. His victim was my oldest daughter (she was 9 at the time). I don't have proof but I feel that gma knew things before they were brought to my attention and he was arrested. She made comments about the situation that implied his actions ""weren't that bad"". 

So maybe I feel resentment towards her because of her son's actions. Idk. Either way, tomorrow is just another regular day for me and I really don't think I will make that phone call.",1690089721.0

Hi Reddit. My daughter (25F) is getting married in a few months, and I (50F) have had a really hard time finding a dress that fits me well. I finally found this one, and was really excited to show her.

She wasn't very happy with it, and says that it looks a lot like a white dress, and would like for me to return it and pick one in a different color. This surprised me, because her dress is a bright white, and mine is champagne, so I didn't think it would be a problem. 

I told her that I would go look again, but if I didn't find one that looks nice, I still plan to wear this one. She got angry with me and said that I was ignoring her feelings, and that she didn't think I would look very hard, and would end up keeping this dress.

My daughter said that if I couldn't find one in a different color that fits, she would pay for a dye service she found to change the color. I don't want her to do this though, because I can't be certain what condition and color the dress will come back in. And, it feels silly to go to all that trouble to change the color of a dress that isn't white to begin with.

I have asked about two times in total if he could help me at work (due to having more than 50 guests) and he refused to come and help. I’ve switched days with him a couple times for work, then helped him with other stuff in the past. I offered to pay for half to fix his car and the gas to take me on a trip then he demanded I pay for all of it and the gas, stuff like that. He, a few weeks ago, broke his hand during a idiotic fit and our parents threatened to call the police because of it.

But anyways, my brother today called me and asked if I could come in to take over the rest of his shift and help him change some boards (I have had top surgery and I’m still recovering.) since his medicine is making him lightheaded and sick. (My medicine makes me feel the same but I always suck it up. I also hate changing my schedule.)

B(brother): Can you come in and help me change some boards and take over the rest of my shift? I’m not feeling well
Me: Did you talk to Mel first?
B: No, I didn’t, but can you come in?
Me: Dude, it’s 102 out, I’m not walking there. Why didn’t you talk to Mel?
B: I can pick you up
Me: You clearly shouldn’t even drive if you’re medicine is making you feel that way.
B: I don’t care, I can still pick you up.
Me: I’ll talk to Mel and see.

Then I called him two hours after when our boss replied (since he broke his phone two months prior) and told him she can take over. He continued asking and basically begging me to just go over and take over.
I told him if he paid me back for my food HE ate (he never asked if he could have it) I’d help then he told me “I won’t be paying you back EVER because it didn’t have a name on it.” After that I told him “Then I’m not going to help you with shit.” Then hung up.
(He’s also told me he wouldn’t be paying our parents rent, it’s just 200 bucks and it goes into savings. He just spends his money on cigarettes n stuff that isn’t healthy physically or mentally.)

I was very much treated as “the baby of the family” and still am kind of. Not to any extreme, it’s more of a joking thing. My dad curses like a trucker and my brother will teasingly say “dad, not in front of the baby”. It’s all in good fun, they’ve never tried to prevent me from growing up or anything. We’re a really close family and hang out a lot. 

I do have a family nickname (a shortened form of my name. Think “Jonny” for John, though that’s not it) that I kind of grew tired of in my teens. I never told them that, though, as it’s harmless and it doesn’t bother me that much. Like I said, they didn’t know I didn’t like it and I know if I had told them, they’d stop immediately.

I’ve been dating “Ashley” for a few months now. When she met my family, they called me by that nickname. She used it after we left and I playfully rolled my eyes, saying “I hate that name”. She was confused and asked why they called me that then. I said I never made a big deal of it and it really doesn’t matter. I just prefer that outside my parents and siblings, others don’t use it. I also asked that she not say anything to them. She said okay.

We got together last weekend for my mom’s birthday. At one point, my sister asked something along the lines of “Jonny, do you want a soda?” Ashley went to help her. I didn’t think much of it.

After the party, my mom called and asked “So…how long have you hated that we call you Jonny?” My stomach dropped. I asked why she would assume that and she said Ashley told my sister she should stop calling me that as I hated it. My sister waited until the party ended to say anything as she didn’t want to cause drama. She told our parents so they would know not to call me that anymore.

I told my mom it was okay. It’s not that I truly mind. She said if I told them sooner, they would’ve stopped. I said seriously, don’t worry about it. She asked if I was sure a few times. I could tell she felt really guilty and that made me sad.

I called Ashley after and asked why the hell she would say that. She said she was just trying to help out. I said she had no business saying anything. She’s told me secrets and I’d never dream of repeating them. She kept saying I was overreacting and I should thank her. I told her she caused a bunch of drama over nothing. She told me I was ungrateful. I hung up the phone. She’s texted me a few times since and I haven’t responded. Basically her gist is I shouldn’t have told her if I didn’t want her to say anything.  My point is she never said she couldn’t keep a secret and she knew I wanted it to stay secret.

My maternity leave was not paid so I ran out of my savings and had to go back to work when my baby was barely 2 months. I was paying a babysitter, but then he decided he didn’t trust her so he said he was going to take care of him while I was working. 
I got a promotion with more responsibilities. So I’m being a first time mom, full time job, (adding some stress ahead) my brother is in jail causing lots of family issues, had my car hit and run, and having some other bad stuff going down the last couple of months have not being easy.
Meanwhile my husband has had lots of stress loads because of his career path and he’s barely sleeping (his classes are at night and he does all his assignments during the night) and taking care of the baby during day (my working hours only). He also had a week of vacation 2 weeks ago. 
SO HERE IT IS. The stress around has been a lot lately, and he was about to fail a class due to not getting his assignments on time unless “he had a miracle” (his words) and I was feeling sick, so I asked him if me skipped working Friday would help him getting everything on time, he said it would help him (since he wouldn’t have to take care of the baby and if he said it was fine I was going to take Tylenol and go to work). I called and reported sick (got coverage) and stayed. I asked him that if he was able to finish could we spend time together the 3 of us, he agreed. He was able to finish on time because of that. And today Saturday he just said that he forgot to tell me that his little brother (that he haven’t seen in a while) invited him out and that he was going to get ready. I got upset because of what we agreed and the fact that whenever they hang out, he comes back around 1am. 
To clarify something he doesn’t hang out with his family or friends because he doesn’t want to. And whenever his family invite us 3, only the baby and I end up going, they have stopped asking for him already (my family too).

This went on for a couple days until I finally just sent her a photo of my incision while I was still in the hospital and a photo of the disc they removed (neither of them were bloody or overly grotesque).

I didn't hear back from her for a day, so I just kind of forgot about it until I started getting messages from mutual friends telling me that it was disgusting of me and that she is now traumatized from seeing my photos.

I’ve been a huge part of the kids life while Abby tries to get back on track. At 23 we decided that she needs to go back to school since she can’t support herself being a waiter. The whole time I was the free babysitter, basically raising the kid. 

So she one year left of her higher education, and she fucked it up again. So grandkid two is coming and she said she will most likely drop out again. When she told me, I asked if she was joking. She got defensive and asked what I meant. I told her that she needs to get her crap together. It resulted in an argument, which she stormed out after calling me an asshole

My other daughter said I should post her and see if I was an asshole.

Edit: So I have a plan now and I will lay it out for her tonight. If she has the kid, she can only stay if she stays in school. She has to go to court and get child support for the first kid and do the same when the other one arrives. 

 I will only babysit twice a week and real emergency. If she needs me to babysit more she needs to pay, and it will be the cost of the average babysitter where I live. She needs to provide all the baby’s stuff, I’m not paying.

AITA for lashing out at my friend?,1,157b8bt,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157b8bt/aita_for_lashing_out_at_my_friend/,7,"So, it's a very petty srgunent and I always see big stuff here but this has been bothering me so much.

I've always lived in a small town 30 minutes away by bus from a big city. I went to high school in the big city and obviously all my friends live there and we've always hung out there.
Now, with a friend of mine (who has never even come to my house because ""it's too far"") we were planning to go to the movies and where I live there's this really big cinema with extral lux seats and a new gorgeous screen,a cinema that in the big city there is not.
We wanted to go, but she immediately said she wasn't in the mood to spend 30 minutes on a hot bus (mind you, we would've gone to a night show anyway, so it wouldn't be that hot, just btw)  just to come see a movie. 
I lashed out, on the premise that for the past 6 years I've always, always gone to the big city by myself (I don't have a car or a driver's license because I've been in a hard financial situation for the past two years) and she simply responded with ""you can't force me to sweat on a bus to come see a movie when I have a worse cinema which I can reach by bike. I don't even care about the movie "".

Lets call her ally. Ally doesn't have a lot of social media so she emailed me throughot the year trying to make plans to hang out with our friend group since she didn't have any of our other friends emails. I ended up planning the whole thing because she seemed to really want to hang out. It was difficult to find a day we were all free but we managed to find a day and decided to go to a board game cafe. I messaged everyone the average price people spend there but I guess I forgot to mention the specific price to Ally. 

Whenever we planned things before, I told Ally that we were paying for ourselves/splitting the bill between everyone. This time I forgot but I assumed she would already know this (maybe it was wrong of me to assume?) Also they have a website where you can check out their prices.

Anyways, the day after we hung out, Ally messaged me telling me since I planned this, she thought I would pay and that she would like a warning next time because she didnt think shed be spending money (it was around 16 dollars depending on the tip and stuff). I was a bit shocked since out of all of us, I'm unemployed because of an arm injury and my mental health so to expect me to pay around 80 dollars was kind of crazy... She kept of saying throughout the day when we hung out that it was my idea to hang out when I made the plans for her since she kept on asking when we were going to hang out next and she didnt have any means of reaching out to our other friends... 

Am I the asshole? 

Tldr: friend wants to hang out. I planned it out for her, she said ok but messaged me later saying that she expected me to pay for everybody since it was my idea and I didn't warn her that we were paying for our own stuff.

Am I the asshole? 
Me, 29F him 36M, live together and been together 2 years. 

My boyfriend smoked ribs for the first time today. He really wanted me to try them, ask what I think. I tell him they’re fine, something about them taste gritty but overall tender. 

He says I’m the asshole because I “need to learn to talk to people” and be more tactful. I told him he shouldn’t have asked if he didn’t want to hear my real opinion and he basically wants me to lie to him going forward. I don’t love that. He likes to cook and I often do not like the way he makes things, to be clear, I can cook for myself and often tell him that we can do our own thing. 

I understand he wanted a better response but he’s just learning and I don’t think he should be so sensitive. Honestly this is so petty I’m annoyed.",1690049487.0

After we start eating my boy burped and farted, I found it hilarious as did everyone but P (she frowned) and said “so rude”. I ignored it and said “oopsie , sorry everyone” and took my boy to the toilet. Upon coming back I overheard P saying I was so rude no teaching manners to my son. He is a baby so wth, also everyone but her laughed.
Anyways, almost at the end of the meal. Her boy asks P to use the toilet like 4 times, and she brushed him off and said “finish eating”. Well, he farted loudly (hope only fart).

I am a SAHM but everyone else works, my husband and I decided I will raise our daughter until she starts school.

Their toddler makes most of the mess, it’s a normal kid behavior but they don’t pick up after his mess or teach him to clean up after himself. The floor is constantly stained with juice, soda, candy, crumbs, etc. I have to clean the floor constantly because my daughter grabs anything she finds and puts it in her mouth, but I find it unnoying and tiring that I’m doing most of the household chores.

My wife has become my sister's rock and support system and I've come to admire them very much because of it. It really has been an amazing thing.

This weekend my sister needed to take one of her son's away for a little league tournament, so my wife volunteered to drive the 2 1/2 hours to spend the nighr with the other 4 kids (the oldest is moved out and on his own).  She has done this a few times in the past by herself, as we have 3 kids of our own and I needed to stay home and watch them.

She looked at me funny and said....""in the bed"".  I just gave her a look as it was sinking in that this was my sister's bed and the very bed my brother in law passed away in.

my mom told me that montana would be the ‘last family trip’ as she planned on divorcing my father. she spent the whole trip drunk, and all my parents did was fight and try to drag all of us into it and make us pick sides. my gf and i did not really get to do anything we wanted to, my brother would just offload his friend onto us and something always had to happen from my parents.

we got a little bit of time to finally just go to dinner together (literally just olive garden) while my bro, dad, and brothers friend went on a fishing trip. my mom drunkenly texted me right as we got there asking us to pick them up food, which i had no problem with, but then started saying i urgently had to get home and pick up everyone burn gel because they were sun burned so bad. seriously, she was acting like they were burn victims and asked me to get 3 of every burn product in cvs. so we wrapped up dinner early and stopped at two different stores (cvs was closed), got home and they literally were all fine. this is just one incident, there were others where we’d go to dinner as a family and she’d be so fucked up i’d have to try and order for her, and literally aim her card into card readers. she would even try to tell me she wasn’t drunk or on anything and just tired lol.

she would also sneak in our room and steal all of our laundry to do it for us and then complain about having to do everyones laundry, and lost/mixed up some of our clothes. anyways moving on, they also paid entirely for all of us on this trip as well, so i feel like i don’t have a place to complain. 

i would rather have the house to myself, my cat, and my girlfriend while they are gone. however i really don’t want to start something and have them to be mad at us because we don’t ever really do anything with them otherwise, and i often find myself avoiding interactions with them. my mom has been better with the drinking since, but i still feel like my relationship with my parents is weird and kind of distant. they are usually nice to my face so i feel guilty for wanting to say no, but i still hear them talking shit about me behind my back sometimes (like rude comments on my appearance and other things) and i don’t want a repeat of last trip.

Me and my roomates have designated nights for when each of us cook dinner for everyone but since starting me diet I've been making my own dinner every night and been making a separate meals when it'd my night to cook now my roomate Maya had caught onto this and has started chucking a tantrum every night saying I'm purposely triggering her by eating low calorie meals. Maya struggled with anorexia during highschool where she either ate nothing or ate something with little to no calories in it my roomates and I know about her past and don't bring it up unless she does.

Now Maya is refusing to eat unless I eat the same dinner as them this has been going on for a few nights and sometimes I cave just to make sure Maya eats but I've talked to my roomates about this and they keep telling me to suck it up as its better to do this then see Maya not eat her dinner. But I've come to a decision that if I want my diet to work i need to be consistent with it so against what Maya and my roomates have said I'm eating my own separate dinners and eating in my room and not the living room like we usually do just so I don't have to deal with them.

Both of us are in the beginning stage of our careers, and would need a few years to be financially stable to present our present our relationship and then plan any wedding. A wedding is not something that we need right now. 
But my age is were a girl typically gets married in India. And my parents want me to get married to guy that they are planning to find. 

I cannot tell them about my boyfriend right now because we neee to focus on our career, and because we are from slightly different cultural backgrounds, which, from what I have seen happen to a few other family members, my parents and family will against. They want someone from our same cultural and religious beliefs. 

They are emotionally blackmailing me and trying to get me married to any stranger they think will be suitable for. This has been going on for a while and even though this makes me very angry, I have kept calm until now. 2 days ago I was so angry that I raised my voice against my parents that I wont listen to them and I won't even think about until I want to.

I went over to speak to my neighbours about it and what they wanted to do, and I was told they were having the fence replaced anyways for some deck/patio work they were doing and they’d take care of it. 

I asked about timeline and cost and to the best of my recollection they said it would be a bit and they would let me know about cost when they had started to get more information. 

Then around spring time, some stuff started to happen with their deck. So I asked again about the fence. I was told not to worry about it when I asked about cost. 

This happened a third time when work really began on the fence and the neighbours asked if I wanted a gate. I said that would be great and to please let me know the cost and again asked about paying for half the fence. I was told not to worry about the fence and they’d let me know about the gate. I never did hear about the gate (it was never built though it was framed in - it was framed across both our properties, how they built the fence required the gate framed into my deck). After this third time, I didn’t ask again. 

At no point was I ever consulted about cost. I was never asked an opinion on material, no quotes presented, nothing. They made all the decisions on their own without consulting me. I asked several times and was told not to worry. So I didn’t. 

Well today, a heated discussion about the fence took place. Apparently to them, I didn’t ask, I wasn’t told not to worry about it and I’m benefiting from the expensive fence (it is a nice fence, and I am sure it was expensive) and I should pay them. 

In the heated discussion the cost went from $200 to $2000 to $3000), and when asked for invoices to review the costs, they rolled their eyes at me. 

Part of me feels like I should pay something, the other part of me says no. I asked multiple times, and not only did they say no, they also didn’t consult with me at any point about the costs and decisions for the fence.

anyway, a few days ago L was driving me to therapy. i already hated this cause she’s emotionally and verbally abusive + G normally takes me. but it became so much worse, i asked L if my great aunt was gonna come with us to the cabin cause she normally does. and well-

L- “no why?”

me- “just wondering.”

L- “you and C are NOT sleeping in the same room i hope you know that, you’ll have to sleep with G!”

me- “why can’t i just sleep in a different bedroom? you sleep on the couch anyway.”

L- “cause i know how you are, i will not have another incident!!”

(for context an ex boyfriend of mine was really mad and told L i was pregnant so.)

me- “well what if G sleeps in the bedroom next to mine and C’s? i’ll sleep in the extra bed in that room.”

L- “i don’t understand why it matters! you’re just gonna sleep.”

me- “cause i don’t wanna share a bed with G if i don’t have to. plus not like anything is gonna happen. the walls are paper thin too. and last time you let *ex* sleep in the same room as me.” 

L- “well that was before you decided to be a wh0re. stop getting an attitude with me, i don’t understand why you hate me so much!!!”

me- “well if you’d stop being a bitch to me all the time then i might be a little nicer.”

at no point did i raise my voice. she was screaming the whole time.  i understand some of her points but at the same time she could at least compromise, right? she knows the whole “incident” was a lie. also G agrees with me cause she knows how L’s behavior is. she’s always yelling and stuff like that.

I am not a dog person, she is a dog but. She begged for me to let her two dogs come, and I conceded because she was doing me a favour. I was robbed last holiday, so wanted safety but also I have about 20 indoor pot plants that she was watering.

We caught up today now I'm back, at a mutual friends house. She ofc persuaded the mutual to allow her dogs. We were just sitting and chatting while her dogs were wandering around sniffing and exploring. They wandered out of the room and into other parts of the hosts house but my friend did nothing.

Well one of them came back and then lifted it's leg and peed on the leg of the coffee table. The host was mortified, but my friend tried to defend herself ""these things happen because I don't neuter my dogs, it's so much kinder to them to let them be"".

So I went off at her, basically saying she's irresponsible af. After thinking I realised her dogs probably marked their territory all over my house. They're both unneutered make dogs and she didn't seem shocked they marked here, so it may be common. 

She called me over dramatic and said they were perfect at mine. But the thing is, I know they went in to rooms I doubt she'd go in, like my office, a storage room, the spare bedroom etc because of the immense hair left (they're both German shepherds). I've been on walks with her, they stop and mark every tree, fence, mailbox, and bush. 

AITA for making an accusation? I feel as though my rationale is logical given the evidence I have. She left the dogs alone at mine while she worked.

Apparently my gf was not really motivated during the bachelorette trip and also voiced to some of her friends there that she didn't like the location and some of the activities they had planned. She also mentioned that she was rather quite and didn't participate too much with the other girls on the trip.

This lead to the bride being disappointed with her and telling her shortly after the trip that she felt my gf was disrepctful to her. My gf was not even aware that her actions caused such a big problem on her side (there was no talk or argument during the trip) and felt she was treated unfairly by the bride. Unfortunately she also was not willing to go discuss this issue with the bride and instead there was a falling out between the two of them a short time after. This fight lead to the bride disinviting my gf from the wedding. 

My friend and I then tried to bring the two back together, so they can discuss this topic face to face and clear the air but unfortunately we were not able to convince either of them.

From my point of view it felt like my gf was treated unfairly by the bride as the reasons she brought up in a talk with me were kind of shallow. It rather sounded like she didn't like my gf already beforehand and tried to find all kinds of reasons to blame her for her actions. On the other side my gf also probably could have behaved better during the trip and also reacted more mature to the accusations. She basically also started the fight afterwards by provoking the bride during a party we both attented. 

As this was one of my closest friends I still wanted to go to the wedding. So during some discussions my gf and I agreed that I would still attend the wedding, but leave as soon as the official part of the wedding ceremony was done (cutting of the cake/wedding dance). That way I thought we had found a compromise, so I could still attend the wedding of my buddy.

Now after coming back from the wedding we had a huge fight as she told me that she never wanted me to go there in the first place and that I should have left already after the dinner (so 3-4 hours earlier). From her point of view I choose to support my buddy more then her and showed her that I didn't care for her.

AITA here? I feel unfairly blamed for a situation I couldn't really control and also tried to at least amend somehow, which my gf was not really willing to. This was also the third time my gf had a public fight/argument with other people in which she couldn't control her temper/reasoning. In this case I even understand her, but I feel like she could have handled the topic better also from her side.",1690069616.0
AITAH For telling our long distance friends we want to keep our trip separate because her husband made my wife uncomfortable and we never invited them to tag along in the first place?,706,1561rbn,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1561rbn/aitah_for_telling_our_long_distance_friends_we/,98,"A few months ago, my wife and I were planning a long distance trip for two weeks to Japan with one of our closest friends who has never been. We get everything paid for and just sit back. Around the same time, one of my long distance friends catches wind of our trip and starts making comments about how they wish they could go, then turns into them asking about pricing and budgeting, and what it cost.

I go through what the expenses were and realized I should have stopped all talk when they started using the word ""we"" and ""us"" when the trip came up, but i was too excited and missed the signs. I think nothing of it until i was told they were calling me about the trip. Turns out, they wanted to know when our flight was, where the layover was and what info they need for flights. After a brief hold, we talked it over with our friend who was ok with them coming along as long they knew were not going to be attached to the hip.

A couple of months go by and the language they are using, them booking the same resorts as us and wanted to go where we would go, started to bother me, but i let it slide because i reiterated that we are all adults and we will be doing things separately for the majority of the trip. That warning, again, was ignored as  they were asking what days we were going to universal and TDL. We relented on universal but not for TDL. They also were having major issues with their debit card to pay for things, it was continually denied, which was and still is a huge red flag to me, even though eventually it finally went through. They were also talking to my wife looking at her to be ""trip mom"" since she speaks Japanese and can partially read Katakana and some Kanji, which was making my wife extremely stressed out, she did not want to be ""trip mom"" she just wanted to be there and go with the flow

Fast forward to a week ago, and i find out that the husband was being overly friendly and ""lovey dovey"" toward my wife in the claim of being supportive of my wifes ""insecurities"" None of the messages were sexual, but a lot of things a SO or husband/wife would say to each other to comfort them, including offers of being held and hugged for long periods of time. This made her very uncomfortable and like wise, me very upset. I finally put my foot down and said enough is enough.

1 Dont talk to my wife like that anymore

2 Outside universal, we are two separate parties, thats it. and no, my wife is not going to be the ""trip mom"" I will not have my wife be around them if they are going to make her feel uncomfortable

I was briefly helping them budget for for misc items in the hopes they go on their sperate way because a part of me should have put a stop to it at the very beginning before they spent money, but never did, and i feel bad about it. My other major concern is that somehow they are going to get stuck with their ATM/Debit cards not working and look to us for help, which we absolutely will not do.

AITAH for all this? (Crossposted)

To be quite honest, I wasn’t tired, I just didn’t want to look over his shoulder whilst he watched TikTok’s. So I rolled over and did some reading on my phone, he realised and we cuddled and spoke for a bit before he went back on TikTok. He fell asleep with his phone in his hand. I brushed it off and went to sleep. I typically wake up earlier than him, and on this occasion I did. I waited for him to wake up and when he did we spoke and cuddled for a bit before he hopped back on TikTok, then fell back to sleep. I ended up waking him up and telling him that I was going to go. I didn’t see a point staying there any longer, which isn’t normal of me, I usually enjoy spending time with him. He has since messaged me asking if and why I was upset when I left. Do I be honest?

I share a front street with 3 other neighbors. The corner neighbor has a side street to also park on. We have space for 5 cars out front, and everyone has a single car garage. It is a public street so there is no reserved parking. 

The corner neighbor off the main street parks in front of their place like 90% of the time and parks another car in back. My second neighbor has always parked two cars out front and none in back. I'm in the third house. Last neighbor usually parks on the side street, but out front at times. Neighbor across the street often takes a spot, but doesn't park on the street next to their house as of lately. 

I was fine with my neighbor taking 2 spots, because we had 5 open, but now they added another roommate and often they take 3 spots. I like my neighbors and that's sort of why I was cool with them taking two spots, but i haven't been able to park in front of my house for a week. 

Ya, I may be a bit neurotic about this. Partly because I live in a city with high auto theft rates and I have had my car totalled while parked before, so I like to be able to see it from my house. I'd really like to be able to park in front of my house, especially since I respect their abilities to park in front of their house. It's really making me sort of resent them and I need some outside feedback to tell me if I should stfu and accept it, or possibly bring it up. Thanks.",1690103840.0

A lot of the people on my shift are younger guys who like to chatter on the radio. The nature of the job being a sawmill, machines will usually go down because something breaks, someone makes a mistake, or any number of variables. In comes the coworker in question. He’s probably around 24 years old. I’m 29 for reference. 

Whenever a machine goes down or someone makes a mistake he is always the first person on the radio saying something like “wow why’d you do that”, or “how did THAT happen”. Mind you, it’s a single channel radio for the whole mill, so everyone basically hears anyone on the radio. He’ll continue doing this for most of the night, then eventually another coworker will say something about it, to no avail since he doesn’t stop. It isn’t until it goes on for a while that the supervisor will tell both parties to stop. 

He’ll try doing this with me, and on multiple occasion I’ll try to shut him down or ignore him completely so he stops talking. If you were wondering what kind of character traits to associate with him, he likes beating jokes into ground until they’re basically dust. Also seems to have the “cool kid syndrome” where his popularity peaked in high school and he’s carried that mentality with him even into his mid twenties. 

Anywho. A couple of weeks ago, he was up to his usual self, but tried doing it to me in person. Meanwhile I’m busy trying to change 4 massive bandmills in a machine standing on a shakey metal platform above a 6ft drop. As he finishes his “joke” I look him straight in the eyes and tell him to “shut your F***ing mouth”. He just stood there and smiled back at me as if I was making a joke, until he finally walked away.

He hasn’t spoken a single word to me since then, which I consider a small miracle. Though he still continues his antics with other workers. With the machine I work at, I’m separated from the rest of the mill, so for most of the shift I’m just forced to listen to the radio chatter, which ends up being dominated by the coworker in question.

AITA for avoiding my friend after she refused to meet me in public?,13,156umz4,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156umz4/aita_for_avoiding_my_friend_after_she_refused_to/,5,"I'm not an English native speaker, sorry for eventual mistakes. 
A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT:
I (35f) have been friends with Sandra (32f) for 15 years. When we met I was at university and she was still in high school, but we clicked since the first moment. We've been through so many things together during all these years, always side by side, constantly texting everyday, etc. 
She comes from a difficult family situation, so she didn't have (and still hasn't) her own car, but she has a driving license. We live 30kms apart, so I've always been the one that drives. 
I used to visit her at home or take her from her home and go around for shopping, clubbing, parties and everything. I've never asked her for gas money or toll money, because I knew her financial situation was not that good. It's never been a problem, because she was my best friend and when she could afford it, she used to offer me meals and drinks. 
Some years ago, she met her boyfriend Alec, who also didn't have a car. We used to hang out all the 3 of us, I used to go to pick them up and do our errands. After some time, I had the impression that he was slightly annoyed by the situation, but I didn't say anything to not start up a fight between them. 

THE FACT:
Now that we're in our 30ies, we have a hard time seeing each other (work, no free time, always tired, you know, adult life) but still texting everyday. 
She still hasn't her own car, but her boyfriend does.
Note that when we meet, it's always me going to them, while they came to me only once. 
They often go visit one of Alec coworkers that lives in my city, but never invite me or come to visit me when they're in my town. 
On a national holiday sunny day, I was having a nice time visiting a little city by the sea with my boyfriend, when she texts me asking what I was doing that day. I replied saying where I was and she said she was just arrived in the same location with her boyfriend. From that moment, it started an awkward conversation where she keeps saying we have to meet each other and drink something, she constantly updates me with her position but never settle there to wait for me to reach her. Tired of this nonsense, I just tell her that I'm sitting at a pub, name and position of the place, so she can come over and join us. Me and my boyfriend did our things, drinking and chilling, but she didn't show up. Eventually, we decided to leave because it was getting late. I tell this to Sandra, and she jokes about the fact that we didn't meet, but that I can go to pick her up at her house the next day after work to drink something. 

I politely decline the invitation but since that day I started to see her in a different way and I stopped texting her everyday. She didn't ask why, because probably she perfectly knows the reason. 

My boyfriend expressed his feelings on this situation, but I need a second opinion. AMITA? Am I being too childish?",1690058348.0
AITA for asking my girlfriend to return the birthday present she got for me?,12,156vg8l,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156vg8l/aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_to_return_the/,33,"My \[19m\] girlfriend \[18f\] knows that I like cologne and collect them, and so for my birthday, she got me a cologne bottle that's $200-- $400 based off where you get it from. The issue is, I don't like the smell of it at all-- it's too citrusy and strong to the point it smells like soap. Plus, it gives me a headache when I wear it due to the smell, and since other people smell you more so than you do, I assume it's even more headache inducing for others.

I don't blame my girlfriend for her choice, she's not super well versed in colognes and likely just picked a popular one from a brand she recognized. But this puts me in a tough position-- honestly, I know I'll almost never wear it, so either I just let it collect dust and have my girlfriend's money go to waste, or I tell her we can return it and go shopping together to pick out something we both like.

I decided to go with the latter, because I thought if I was in her position, I'd want to know she didn't like my present so I could actually get her something she liked and would use. After all, a) that's the purpose of a birthday present, to make the person whose birthday it is happy b) if I was spending a lot of money, I'd want it to go to good use.

So I told her, and she reacted very negatively, calling me a huge AH for not appreciating the present and that it's the thought that counts, and that I'm being a bad boyfriend by not being appreciative. I'm taken aback by her reaction-- how am I being turned into the bad guy here for not liking a cologne and wanting her to not waste her money? I feel she's being self centered. AITA?",1690060329.0

For one of my sisters I was in both of her weddings and was excited for her to be a part of mine. Throughout the entire planning process she was MIA never responded to my texts or confirmed times that worked for her to come with me to find my wedding dress. Two months before the wedding I text all my bridesmaids to ensure they all had their dresses and were fitted and ready to go, my sister did not respond to that message either. To be crystal clear, none of these reasons are why I asked her to step down during the ceremony. She had been suffering seizures and during my final walkthrough with my coordinator I asked about accommodations for my sister during the ceremony. The gazebo we would be standing under has a waterscape, lots of rocks, bricks and pillars along with many plants so I was afraid that she could possibly suffer a seizure during the ceremony and hurt herself or others. The wedding coordinator said that she couldn’t accommodate something like that due to liability issues but my sister could sit with the guests during the ceremony. When I had to ask my sister to sit down during the ceremony I was very tearful and hurt because this wasn’t at all how I envisioned my wedding. She said she understood and she was okay with that. I found out later she in fact was not okay with that. She told everyone in my family that I used her condition as a weapon against her and to control her and I kicked her out of my wedding. She even convinced them all that my wedding was her “only joy” and had been looking forward to being there for me. Since she is going through this medical issue and an impending divorce to her second husband. When the things I mentioned before that she was absent for did not translate that she even cared about my wedding. My mom and brother, and nieces all got mad at me and my mom even stopped paying for my flowers when that was her only contribution to my $25k+ wedding. I was devastated and tried calling and texting my sister numerous times but she blocked me. While I was blocked she reached out to everyone trying to turn them against me and not come to my wedding. She even wouldn’t allow her kids, my niece and nephew to be my flower girl and ring bearer anymore. the morning of my wedding my mom told me my brother had come to Vegas from Florida but was not going to attend my wedding because of what I did to my sister. I also had begged my brother in law to please allow my nephew to be the ring bearer(my niece is not his child so he could not make that decision)so when he showed up I was surprised he had my nieces with him. They were very nasty to me even though I allowed them to stay in my bridal suite and take pictures with us. I felt cornered and hated by my family even though I truly felt like I was being selfless and thinking about my sister and her health condition. I tried to explain that and defend myself against my brother and my mother but they already decided IWTAH regardless. My wedding day was full of toxic family members making everything about them but in the end I still married the man of my dreams. I just wanted an unbiased opinion about the decision I made and if i brought this all upon myself.",1690062049.0

I love my boyfriend very much, we are planning to get married in about one year, we live in another country from my parents and he's been everything to me, he's handsome, such a good company and considerate. Hes very hard working and sometimes works everyday for months for our future.I also struggled with money before meeting him and once he settled in my life has become so much easier as he's in charge of the finances and savings.
I'm really tired of her putting him down and never asking how he's doing considering he's been the one bringing happiness and security into my life.

I also have a background of an abusive relationship with someone with a 18y age gap, whith kids from another marriage, who turned out to be narcissistic and abusive, which at the beginning was 'praised' by my mother as a good match for me. Only i know how long it took me to recover from that...

This morning i told her it was not ok to be talking about some stranger like they're amazing (while A. was listening) and never ask about how my boyfriend is or always asks me to call her when I'm alone which implies she doesn't like it when my boyfriend joins the conversations as well. She began excusing herself that D. is 20 years older than my cousin and it shows how mature he is, it triggered me about my past relationship and i called her a jerk and told her that instead of praising age gaps she maybe could have taught me about self worth. 

She got really upset that i called her a jerk and she doesn't speak to me anymore. 

She also does this constantly about any topic that relates to me, like how much I'm making, how I'm having the same job since 4 years and I'm not advancing in career, etc..

It made me uneasy and made me think about how little she praises my boyfriend for how much he's supporting me mentally and financially.

The thing is my room is decorated with a ton of sleazy pin-up posters. I know it's kind of in bad taste but at 16 and 17 I was dying to be “edgy” and “cool.” But Charlotte has told me she doesn't mind, there's one picture in particular she adores and she doesn't care if I don't take them down.

My mom however thinks it's incredibly disrespectful for me to expect a young woman to be comfortable with those types of exploitative pictures in her room.

I also have autism and am sensitive to certain things, especially certain textures, sounds, and flavors. Anything other than cheese and maybe normal slice of tomato on a burger makes me feel nauseous, I think it is something about the flavors and/or texture. But even after I wipe everything off it still tastes really gross and I don't want to eat it again.

I have told him about this so many times, and tonight he directly said that he would bring me a burger with just cheese and now is yelling at me and calling me a worthless ungrateful ahole and threatening to kick me out into the streets of our rural area and take my phone(that he got me last year because my old phone had stopped working after nearly 3 years) because I don't wanna eat the burger.

AITA for dropping out of my friends wedding?,30,156le93,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156le93/aita_for_dropping_out_of_my_friends_wedding/,21,"Okay let me start this by saying I am the type of person who never wants to upset anyone and had a very guilty conscience so I know how this sounds but please let me explain….

My (F21) friends, let’s call her Laney (F22) asked me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding over a year and a half ago. The wedding is now in November and since then circumstances have changed. When I committed to being in her wedding we were very close, texting almost daily and we were suppose to live together the following semester at college. The day we were suppose to move in, with her and our other mutual friend, she texted us saying she wouldn’t be moving in any longer and would be moving in with her fiancé to save money for the wedding. Understandable, though I would’ve liked to know a little sooner than move in day. Since then we have hardly hung out and every time we have it has been at a wedding related event, like a shower, and mostly all communication texting wise has been about the wedding through a bridesmaids GC or DM relating directly to the wedding. Fast forward to now, and it has come time to start sending money for the bachelorette party. The amount we need to sends keeps changing (can’t decide on a airbnb) and new things keep popping up daily that I get venmo requests for (like bachelorette party bride surprise, charcuterie boards, drink fund etc). All of this I completely understand and I know is normal for a bachelorette party/wedding party commitments. However since being asked to be a bridesmaid my financial situation is no longer as steady as it was. I begin unpaid student teaching in two weeks so that I can graduate in December and quite frankly the little money I do have saved up I need to use for living and school expenses. So with all this being said, would I be the asshole for dropping out of the wedding?",1690035654.0
AITA for trying to help my sister who loses her keys all the time but my idea backfired horribly?,4157,155lhsj,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155lhsj/aita_for_trying_to_help_my_sister_who_loses_her/,2423,"Hello AITA. First time posting and I’m using a burn account because in light of the situation it feels like the safest thing to do. 

My little sister (21) is constantly losing things but her keys are the main culprit. She for loses them around the house but at least 50 times since she’s been driving she’s lost them in public and a few of the times have been very scary because she got her self stranded. 

In early June she lost her keys and had to pay a ton of money to get her remote lock reprogrammed. Last Friday she lost them again in a grocery but was lucky enough that the cashier found her and gave them back as she was frantic in the store. So I had a little tag made up that had her name, phone number and address so she wouldn’t have to go through replacing them again.

Earlier this week she went to six flags great adventure with some friends and truly, truly lost her keys. When she got home her car was gone. Yesterday the police found her car but completely chopped with the key in the ignition (but her house and work keys were gone). I hope it’s obvious what the police think happened. 

She’s furious with me and my parents are mad as well saying I should have minded my own business. She knew the little tag was there and she even thought it was a good idea. I don’t know if I’m the AITA because she is the one who lost her keys again but it was my idea that backfired.

My fiancé proposed to me last year and we have been planning the wedding but also planning to move into a home that we can call ours. I initially told my fiancé that I wasn’t selling my house because I thought it would be good for a rental property. He told me he felt it would make more sense to sell my house and use that money to put toward our new home so we can get something bigger and better than what we were originally looking for. I told him I didn’t want to combine that money with the new house money seeing as how I got this home on my own before even being with him and it didn’t make sense to combine the two. He came back and asked if the money didn’t go toward the new house, could it at least be placed in our joint bank account. I again declined that offer essentially for the same reason as before. He invested no money into the home, so I don’t think it’s fair to ask for money from it. I also want to note that my fiancé and I make around the same yearly. He’s now upset because he feels as thought I don’t want to invest in our future and somehow me keeping the money from my house to myself is kind of sneaky. I assured him that I would still be paying toward our new home the same way he would, but I’m just not using the funds from my old home to do it. AITA?",1689979303.0

My son is a very picky eater and my wife (32F) who usually is great with that wasn't at home, because she had practice for a play she's in. My son decided that he wanted chicken nuggets, so i decided that I was gonna air fry the nuggets, which usually wouldn't be a big deal at all. I made my son a plate and called him over to the dinner table.

He sat down but didnt immediately start eating. I couldn't figure out why, but it turns out that its because he didnt get to see the nuggets come out of the oven. Seeing as i didnt even cook the nuggets in the oven, i told him that and he went ballistic. He started crying and i tried to tell him that they were still good, its the same. He kept crying and I figured it was because he was hungry. I got him an apple and cut that up for him and he didnt want that either. 

I was trying my best to stay patient here but i have to admit it was really frustrating to deal with. I eventually got mad and put the nuggets back on a tray and put it in the oven and then he complained that they weren't ""actually"" cooking, because normally they cook for 15 minutes or something. Well i decided that if he wanted his nuggets cooked again then id cook them again. I put them in the oven for 30 minutes and they looked disgusting when they came out. This is what my son wanted though, so i tried to get him to eat it.

And he didnt want to again. At this point it had been an hour and a half of trying to feed him. I was done. I made him eat it anyway because thats all he wanted. He cried and my wife yelled at me when she got home. She took my son to her mom's and i think that was a crazy overreaction.

So today I took my kayak to a local creek that a lot of people paddle board on but also go on jet skis and speedboats and party barges. I was on the water for about 3 hours, sunburnt and exhausted, and I backed my car into one of three boat ramps (all of which were empty) so I could hitch my kayak onto my car.  


For some background information I (23f) am about 160 lbs with absolutely no upper body strength and I was trying to lift a 50 lb kayak on top of my forester. There’s no way I could’ve carried my kayak to the parking lot, and I was already there struggling to push it on my car.  


So as I was lifting it this boat with a bunch of half naked 20 somethings pulls up and one of the girls starts shouting “hey lady”. I ignored her because I didn’t think they were talking to me, but then she started shouting aggressively so I turned around. She crossed her arms and said “can you move? You can go put that up over there” and motioned to the parking lot 30 feet away. I was astounded as there were two other completely open ramps that were also bigger than the one I was in so I just pointed at the open ones and went back to looping my kayak straps. Then the wannabe Barbie started getting fussy and shouted “hey lady you’re in the way”.   


I was tired and halfway through getting my kayak properly strapped down so it doesn’t fall and break, or worse, go through someone’s window when I’m driving home, and so I ignored her. I heard her mutter something to one of her friends so I decided that although I considered pulling away with loose straps to tighten them elsewhere (which I already didn’t want to do since the kayak could’ve fallen and broken), I’d just finish the job tightening the straps there.   


When I told my mom all of this she was furious. 
Living in Texas, it seems like anyone wants an excuse to shoot anyone, at least according to my mother, and she told me I should’ve just pulled my kayak aside and moved my car for them since those ramps are generally for big boats. There were no signs anywhere saying it was meant only for big boats though, and there are no designated kayak put in spots. So was I the asshole for not moving?

WIBTA for not attending my sisters graduation?,5,156x4v1,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156x4v1/wibta_for_not_attending_my_sisters_graduation/,9,"I 20M am in the UK, my sister 22FM has the graduation ceremony in two days. A month before this, she bought tickets ONLY for my parents to attend the venue, the deadline for tickets has long passed and it is obvious she had no intention of me attending for whatever reason.

We have never really got on as siblings, in heated arguments she has resorted to some low things towards me and my parents, she is not a nice person and effectively controls the family through emotional manipulation. She blows all her money and constantly asks my father for money despite him constantly working overtime as a bus driver with a bad back just to make ends meet.

The other day she screamed at me because I stank apparently, and called me g\*y and all sorts of untrue disgusting things and appeared confrontational for answering her back. During these fits my mum does not reprimand her and enables her craziness which really makes me feel like the whole family is damaged.

The problem is my parents, they both want me to attend the graduation for pictures, my sister has literally said NOTHING regarding the graduation to me, not the date, not the time, everything I've found through my parents. Their main point is that I have time off from work that day, and I should at least attend for pictures. I don't see the point in waiting outside the venue for hours to get pictures with someone who acts nice when they feel like it. I was also planning to revise for a resit exam I have from university on the day I had free time. I should add when I ask her she seems like she couldn't give any less of a shit if I came or not.

I haven't had time to buy a smart outfit for the occasion even if i wanted to come, again, because she didn't tell me specifics of the day.

and so I would like to ask if not attending and going against my parents wishes, despite being available, would make the TA.  I understand family should stick together, and graduations only happens once (although she will probs have another as shes doing a masters).

AITA for telling a close friend that I have all my summer vacations planned and that I don’t have time for her?,2,156zvad,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156zvad/aita_for_telling_a_close_friend_that_i_have_all/,12,"This week I submitted my summer vacation plan to my boss at work (as requested by him) and he approved roughly 7 days out of the 14 that I asked because we’re currently understaffed. 
I then proceeded to plan said vacation around some friends that live 275 km (171 miles) from where I live. 
Enter this close friend of mine to the fray. She lives 635 km (395 miles) from where I live. 

She asked me to go to her house in my vacation time, as usual. 
But this year I decided on not going, because she’s having legal troubles (nothing criminal, just inheritance stuff because she lost her father in January) and she’s breaking up with her boyfriend, and I simply didn’t want to end up being the unpaid couple therapist or spend my limited vacation time in a solicitor office (been there, done that, both for her in a summer vacation roughly 5 years ago). 

So I told her I already paid the airplane tickets to go somewhere else this summer (not necessarily true, yet) and that I couldn’t go to her for that reason. 

She replied to me to “just change the tickets, I need you to help me with the legal stuff because I don’t understand it at all. You are good with stuff like this, and I don’t need the extra expenses for legal advice from official channels”. 

I said to her that I couldn’t change anything, that it was a package deal, and she still told me “okay, but I need you, I’m sorry that you wasted your money like that and if you come to me I will repay your lost package deal”. 

I then finally told her the truth: that I didn’t want to spend my limited vacation time working, not even for her, and that after this hellish work semester (understaffing is becoming a real issue, but the pay is good) I deserved some time off. 

At first she just replied “Oh, okay then…” but since then she’s tried at least 4 times to guilt-trip me (from my prospective it’s what she’s doing, I might be wrong) into changing my plans, saying basically that I’m a bad friend, that I’m not doing enough for our friendship and that she, in my place, would drop everything and come to me (a thing that I’ve done too, immediately after her father died, to be close and of any support to her).

I love her to bits, and I’m really sorry she’s still having legal troubles with her father’s inheritance after all this time, but I really need this vacation to be as relaxing as possible as I know the hardships that will come in September at my workplace.
I’m sincerely at loss and don’t know what to do, but as of now I plan to stand my ground. 
But the doubt has already made his way in: am I being too selfish? 

If I could have had my full 14 days (like I had all previous years) I could have gone 1 week to her and 1 week to my other friends (a thing I’ve done before) but since I only have 7 days I just want to relax before being trapped in an office 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, until December.

She also claims that we previously talked about this and that we agreed to wake her up in that situation, but she never clarified if that means she wants us to wake her up if it's late at night and she has work, which is why we were uncertain about what decision to make.

So I’ve been seeing this girl for a little over two months and this weekend she was going to come over. My roommate (also my sister) says she has a problem with it bc she wants privacy before she goes back to work on Monday. She has had some personal issues this past month, too which are definite contributing factors to her being so difficult. I feel as though we could respect her privacy but she disagrees as “she can hear everything in our 3 br apt.” So naturally I got confrontational and told her I pay rent too and should be allowed to have people over as I please (within reason). Fact of the matter is this would have been the second time she’s ever been over as I normally go to her house.
   Now, nasty things were said and so clearly there are other grievances at play, and the argument quickly started to go off track. For context, she agreed to get this apt with me last November to help me out of a toxic relationship. She threw that in my face and I told her by doing that it stops being an act of generosity and is now manipulative behavior. But i don’t really care about any of that as it’s not too far off base for her. I am no saint and can be hurtful at times but as siblings I guess this can happen. Her behavior isn’t great either but that’s not really relevant. 
   So, after the fight when things calmed down I asked politely about the girl coming over to which she replied that if “if I say no isn’t she gonna come over anyway + yeah I guess it’s fine” (albeit reluctantly). I told her that that is within my right as a 30 yr old with a roommate. At that point she was crying, and I have begun to feel bad. I cancelled my plans with the gf but know that I will resent her for this moving forward. And she would resent me if I proceeded to move forward with my plans. So, I caved.
Unfortunately, I will never be able to give the full context and background as there is a lifetime of extenuating circumstances between siblings at play here. But the short of it is we both think the other is a self serving asshole. However, lately, it feels as though she has really been testing my limits.

WIBTA For suing my pet sitter for emergency medical care?,7,156uwu2,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156uwu2/wibta_for_suing_my_pet_sitter_for_emergency/,27,"My cat (Peanut) has separation anxiety, if he's left alone for more than one night he  makes himself sick. I was going out of town with friends for a weekend and wanted to make sure this wouldn't happen, so I left him with my friend and former roommate (Mary) at her house. I figured since we used to live with Mary, this would be the least stressful option.  
  
When I was dropping my cat off I saw Mary had a packed bag by her garage door. I asked if she was going somewhere and she told me she was. She'd be gone for one night but it would be fine because her sister and brother in law would be staying at her house for the weekend so my cat would be supervised. I was not happy with this because she had only told me about her family visiting, not her own trip. I was the designated driver for my trip and needed to start picking people up from their places so I had no time or other options for my cat's care anymore.  
  
Not even an hour after bringing him home, Peanut started throwing up. I was worried, but chalked this up to the stress of being separated from me and around strangers for the weekend. As he continued to be sick several times over night I took him to the vet right away Monday morning. We spent most of the day there, he got meds and fluids (the usual treatment for the separation anxiety) and we went home again. He did not improve or resume eating, and his stomach was starting to bloat which was very strange given the other symptoms, so we went back to the animal ER a day later.  
  
We got sent from the ER to an animal hospital quickly, where they found the problem: Peanut had eaten something he shouldn't have and needed abdominal surgery. As he had not eaten anything since I had brought him home this must have happened sometime while he was at Mary's. The surgery was successful and the culprit was a piece foam, the stuff used to make custom D&D terrain out of. I don't have this stuff in my apartment, but Mary has it in her house. The piece was just small enough for him to eat but big enough that it was blocking everything (including normal digestive fluid) which explained the bloating.  
  
Peanut is home now with a goofy but medically necessary haircut and he's on track to make a quick and complete recovery. Throughout this whole thing I've been keeping family and friend group chats (a couple of which include Mary) apprised of what's happening. I even specifically told her in a private message what caused the problem but she hasn't said anything to me for days now, so I'm not optimistic that she'll initiate any kind of apology for her part in this. So, would I be the asshole for pursuing legal action against her to recoup some or all of the cost of the veterinary bills for this, about $8K?

Yesterday I finally saw her again and got the „real“ printed out invite, sent pictures of it to him saying look how pretty they are, „finally got the official invite“ and was met with „don’t see anything official, where’s our names, what’s so special about this etc.“ along with a lot of laugh crying emojis. Kinda making fun of me for sending him those pics. Note: our names were written on the envelope which i didn’t send.
This was followed by comments of him saying „I don’t like weddings, I only go to some of friends and family, I don’t care about other people I don’t know, I don’t wanna go to a strangers wedding, I could care less, it’s a sour spot for me, I hate weddings…. Blablabla“ . Sidenote: he was married before for 3.5 years. He never mentioned he has this like „wedding trauma“ which is what it sounds to me like and after seeing his wedding pictures that day wasn’t too bad for him either. 
I‘m just really pissed at him that he’s not willing to go there with me and have a great time but instead makes it out to be this huge drama about not knowing anyone and being at a strangers wedding, and me instead having to be there alone. I don’t know everyone there either, bride and groom and 4 or 5 other people. 
Also, he went with me to a wedding party of a really good friend of mine when we were only together for 4 months last year and it was fine so I don’t get why he’s making such a fuss now. It kinda makes me question things like yeah it’s just a wedding but he’s refusing to come with me, have fun and get to know some people I have in my life and that really hurts my feelings. So AITA for expecting him to go there with me and being pissed that he refuses?

When my brother and i were little, he would comfort us when we were sad by sitting on our laps and purring and he would sit on our feet when our parents were looking for us so we wouldn’t move and would be easier to find. I don’t think I have a single baby/toddler picture without Jack being right there next to me. 

Now that he is about 17, he is an old man and has been sick a lot and not very social. I don’t think that he recognizes us anymore and he mostly just sleeps in the coat closet. 

Jack is like my mom’s baby and she loves him so much. I took him to the vet and the veterinarian said that he was in a lot of pain and appeared to have dementia and cataracts (not sure if I spelled that correctly). I know that If my mom knew the truth about his health she would be devastated especially because there isn’t much we can do for him at this point besides making him comfortable and giving him pain medicine. I told her that the doctor said that he wasn’t in any pain at all but that he was just weaker than he normally is. 

I feel so bad about lying to my mom but since we are approaching his final days, I want her to have some good last memories of him.",1690061699.0

At this point my mum knew and was blaming/ scolding us 24/7 about anything. 

“Time skip” When I was getting ready for work, she accidentally drop my lunch which is rice and some meat (so messy) then well obviously she scold me for it. Honestly my fault I put it there in the first place but when I was cleaning, she kept scolding about things that are not related to the situation mostly about the house is messy and shit (mind you she does not work full time and mostly in her room watching dramas) but it took turn when she said “I pray for you to die” at this point I was keeping my eyes not to water and scream at her “yeayy my mother wish me to die” (i know its not funny but i was being sarcastic to her) and then she said “I pray that you can meet your father and hug together, please die faster” which was not cool cause my dad died since 2015. after cleaning the mess,all I did was just ran to my room and just go to work earlier than I supposed to. So now I mostly ignore her cause those sentence that she said engrave into my brain soul body my whole brainnnn. Eventho some people understand my situation when I spoke to them well, i feel like its a wrong thing to do at the same time cause my mum did try to like be kind to me but I lowkey dont want to lol

I make arts as a hobby, but there was an instance when a sister's friend asked me to draw something for her, I accepted it because I needed to save money for me to be able to buy something that I wanted in the future (if ever there is).

A month ago, my other sister and now my 2nd client (F25) asked me to draw our late grandparents, digitally, and that she will pay me if I accepted it. I told her it will be around 500 pesos or around 9 USD per portrait. She agreed. 

I finished it and I asked for the payment. She thought that she'll only have to pay for 500 pesos (around  9 USD) for the two portraits. I told her that each portrait costs 500 pesos, not 500 pesos for two portaits. She, then, pulled the we-are-family card. She told me that she thought that our grandpa's portrait was free, given that it was my grandparent too. She said that she felt like she was scammed or something. I felt bad and felt like I am making a profit off of my late grandparents. But, in my defense, my sister, my 2nd client, commissioned me and asked me to draw my grandparents. Besides, making art, even if it is digitally, takes time and efforts too. I will also print the portraits and since we do not have a printer at home, I will pay for probably around 100 pesos max (around 2 USD) each, for the two portraits  to be printed. 

I told her that I will not make it for free, considering that we had an agreement and that I spent hours to make it too. I also think that not making it free is the right thing for me to do, especially if my sister is going to act like she made it (she sent pics of the portraits i made in the family group chat that includes our extended family and did not make it clear that she commissioned those). Besides, the time that we made an agreement, it was an artist-client relationship, not older sister-younger sister relationship.

I joined a small company as a frontend intern. There were two other female interns who too had recently joined, same as me, and we were put in the same team.

We were taught the same things from our seniors and worked on the same projects. I was learning faster than them since I had done similar work for personal projects. However, those two girls were not that interested to work and have always complained about it being unpaid, so they also lacked motivation. They were lazy and sloppy. Someone would always have to fix their work and teach them the same things repeatedly.

Fast forward a couple of months, I asked the boss about the pay, and he agreed to pay me the bare minimum. I was happy, though. But he told me that I am the only one getting paid and told me not to talk to them about this since he still was not sure if they were fit to be working there.

They always asked me when I was going to talk about getting paid with the boss. I always told them that I will talk to him about my payments in my own time, and they should do the same. Also i made sure they never mistake me for a friend. I always keep my distance and just talk when they ask for help. 

4 months after joining the company, they finally asked to get paid. The boss refused since they actually have not done anything in those 4 months. Whatever they did, other staff had to fix it. They couldn't be an addition to the team since they only increased other staff's workload. The boss told them that they were a liability and informed them that I had already started to get payments for a few months now and advised them to learn something from me instead.

After learning that I was getting paid and didn't tell them, they lashed out on me. They called me insensitive and a backstabber. I didn't have the guts to tell them that I wouldn't even hire them to be my assistant since they were useless, but I just told them I am sorry. They were crying that they had just wasted their time while I was being paid for the same job. But it was not the same job; we started out the same, but I was always interested in learning even as an unpaid staff. I never complained about anything and just made sure I do my job, even when I was literally penniless, just hoping that one day it would pay off.

I did feel bad since they were not bad people but just lazy and incompetent. They made sure to complain that I was also lazy since I used to watch Netflix in my free time to the boss, lmao. And said some things like they thought we were friends and started to bond (idk when that happened) and also told that I am the reason they are not getting paid since I made them look bad......

Unresolved project,1,1577q5y,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1577q5y/aita_unresolved_project/,5,"So for context, i have a relative who had a situation that wasn’t the best- for privacy sake let’s call it a crazy ex and some familial drama. They ended up needing a place to stay to sort of rebuild I guess. Tbh I don’t know specifics, but I knew enough that when the situation was presented to me, the end goal seemed ok. We’ve got a spot on the back of our property for a septic hook up. My immediate family suggested to this relative that I might be up for renting that space, well, long story short I agreed to let them rent the spot and my family got to work creating a living space they could live in, the catch was they decided to build it from the ground up, well, trailer up, and got the exterior built.

However,  the weather last year turned faster than they were able to get it completed, so the unfinished project was parked in the space in my backyard. And it’s been there since November of 2022. The relatives who volunteered to build it had some stuff happen that took priority for understandable reasons, and have already sunk about 10K plus into the project. My husband himself supplied about 2K worth of items, and the relative who was supposed to move into it I think supplied about the same. However the project is still incomplete, and the relative who was supposed to move into the space has now moved to the other side of the state, all though I’m not sure if this is a permanent move, or if it was meant to be temporary. 

this space has now been occupied and unused, and unavailable for other interested parties for the last 8 months, and the relative who was supposed to move into it texted the project group chat to kind of figure out if/when it was going to be completed. It was responded to that those building it no longer had any additional funds to add to it, and that everyone involved needed to get together to make a plan. Since then NOTHING has happened. And it’s been radio silent, and the monstrosity is still in the space. I have other people inquiring about use of the space. Am i the asshole for wanting to completely remove the abandoned project from the space? Cost of living isn’t getting any cheaper, and help with the mortgage payment sure would be nice. Idk what to do, I’m stuck in the middle but I’m not sure how to handle this situation at all. Thanks in advance!",1690095845.0

There have been good times and bad times, but there has always been a lot of stress. I find that many people glorify the bridesmaid position when it can be a very overwhelming experience, even when you aren't the one getting married. I have always said yes because I love my friends and am happy to stand and support them leading up to and on the day of their weddings because I know how important it is to them. I have decided that if I choose to get married (I have been in a long-term relationship for a few years), it would be very small. I do not want a bachelorette, a wedding shower, or a rehearsal dinner. I would have my one sister as the maid of honor, and no other bridesmaids. My boyfriend and I do not see a wedding as a big necessity for us, and would only have a small one to make our families happy.

I was in a wedding recently, and when speaking to the bride she asked what I would want to do for my own bachelorette party. I informed her I wouldn't want one for myself, but that I have enjoyed other people's (we had just had her party). She was displeased and said that I would have no choice and she would want to have a group dinner with friends at the very least. I said that's not what I would want, but that I was happy to attend and support my friends at their own events. It's just not what I would want for myself. She again informed me that I had no choice and she would throw something for me no matter what, and the subject was dropped. 

I mentioned this interaction to my sister at a later time, and asked if she thought my friends would be angry that I would not ask them to be bridesmaids or to have a bachelorette for me after they had invited me to be in all of their weddings (not all of these people are in the same friend group). She said I could not do that because they would be very offended and I had to reciprocate. 

I love my friends and family but do not see myself having a large traditional wedding. I love to attend them, but just being near to the amount of stress my friends have gone through for their big day has put me off of having my own. We are constantly being asked when we are going to get married, and the pressure has been on for a few years, but I am now afraid to mention what I would want to any of my friends when they ask out of fear that they will be upset with me after how my other friend and sister reacted.

After meeting for food one time and really hitting it off, I agreed to travel to her local town for food, drinks and a movie.
Being kinda poor at the time I brought with me 2 bottles of cheap wine and after a few drinks with our meal we were already buzzed, making out and groping in the booth so we then went to the cinema and started drinking the wine from the bottle during the movie with more heavy petting as the screen was pretty much empty.
As we were both getting drunker, I remember her telling me she found scratching/digging nails super hot and because I was really sexually inexperienced at the time and prone to being a one-pump chump with a new sexual partner, I began scratching her heavily when we were fooling around more and more in the cinema and I could literally FEEL how she was getting more and more aroused from the scratching and I thought this was her ideal kind of foreplay and the easiest way to get her off first so I didn't worry about ""arriving early"".

Being cheap wine, it had a twist off lid and I bent the soft metal to a point and scratched it up and down her arms and thighs as she moaned in my ear for more pain so she would even draw blood.

We stumbled out the cinema and went to a local cheap hotel and after paying her a little ""lip service"" she revealed I was the only guy to ever make her finish (the only other time was with a girl) and I thought to myself, after we did the dead and it was great but over in under 5 minutes, that the job was pretty well done and the whole scratching foreplay was a success.

When we both woke up she was super distant. She barely spoke to me as we got a shower and left the hotel and I walked her to the bus stop she didn't even give me a hug or kiss as she got onto the bus and left.
She messaged me hours later saying that I was a dick and that she used to cut her arms and thighs as a coping mechanism and she was clean for over a year and all her friends were saying I used her tendency to cut herself as a way to just get her into bed and now she's relapsed and feels the urge to get ""back into cutting herself""
I had no idea about the any of this and genuinely thought that if I could get a girl 90% to orgasm through the cutting and scratching that it was a really easy win.

One Friday evening, several months into this arrangement, we had a brief but heated conversation about our individual weekend plans. This particular weekend was my twin sister’s and my birthday. Earlier in the week, I made plans to go out in my birthday with friends. Unbeknownst to me, my mom and sister had planned for us to have a family party. My mom was adamant that I should have checked in with them before making other plans. I thought it would be no big deal if we had lunch on Saturday the day before instead of Sunday the day of and that maybe they should have checked with me.  We don’t have a tradition of celebrating on the specific day when it happens to fall on a weekday so realistically I didn’t have any reason to suspect either one of them would cling to the day of just because this year happened to be a weekend day.

Since he's married to my fiancé's sister, this tension is affecting the family dynamics.

The problem arose during a cottage trip we took together in mid-May. We all decided to carpool in one vehicle, and my brother-in-law offered to pick me up from my place, so we could leave together from my fiancé's house. However, the drive turned out to be a nightmare for me. He drove recklessly, speeding and abruptly switching lanes, which triggered serious panic attacks for me. I expressed my concerns to my fiancé when we arrived at the cottage, and the morning before we left, I asked if they could drop me off on the way back so I wouldn't have to drive with him again.

The trouble began when my brother-in-law found out that I was being dropped off first. He couldn't understand the reason and started questioning everyone, saying things like, ""Why? He's not on the way,"" and ""I can drop you off, don't worry, you're on my route."" While his house was closest to mine, it would still add a 15 to 20-minute detour, so I didn't want to make it awkward and confront him about his reckless driving in front of everyone. Instead, my fiancé and her sister came up with a white lie, saying I had some family obligations that required me to go home early.

However, he continued to pester his wife (my fiancé's sister), arguing that it didn't make sense and that it was selfish of me to inconvenience them. I was taken aback by this, as we often make sacrifices to accommodate his wishes, and this time, I just wanted to avoid a stressful car ride with him. The situation escalated when he started speaking under his breath, making comments about how unreasonable I was being. At this point, I couldn't hold back, and I confronted him, telling him that his driving scared me, and I didn't want to endure panic attacks again.

What got me is, he laughed off my concerns and bragged about never having been in an accident before. Feeling upset, I reached my house and left visibly upset. Since then, there's been a noticeable tension between us, and it's even affecting my fiancé's relationship with her sister.

I believe an apology from him is warranted, but my fiancé and her sister don't see it the same way. They think he might not have understood the depth of my feelings, and that's why he hasn't apologized. But to me, that feels dismissive and hurtful. I expected him to recognize his inappropriate behavior and take responsibility for his actions, especially since we are going to be family soon.

What bothers me is that he recently texted me about something unrelated, not any mention of the incident or an apology. I didn't respond, and now everyone is turning against me, claiming I'm blowing things out of proportion. My b-law's wife even defended him, saying that no one in their family apologizes, and everyone has their own way of expressing remorse. To me, that just sounds like enabling bad behavior.

But i can’t touch the money in my RRSP account without paying a penalty. I receive Disability payments every month, but I can give her some money here and there, but she has a job and I don’t get paid for the work that I do as a Volunteer

Am I an asshole if I stay firm with my answer of saying no sometimes even thought she doesn’t always have food or other necessities? She owes me so much money and every time she promises to pay me back ( I’ve been lenient many times and I’ve suggested that we can set up a payment plan so she doesn’t feel as pressured to pay me back most of her money. ) she hardly sticks to that promise

She lives a harder life than I do, and she also struggles with her mental health. I really honestly care, that’s why I keep overstepping my boundaries and I give her more money so she won’t get kicked out or have to walk home from a place that might take her a day to walk from.

She doesn’t always ask me for money, but she’ll talk to me a lot. Alot of people won’t lend her money or buy her things that she sells, but I also need to save for the future because rent is super expensive here and I’m lucky that my current rent is affordable. But eventually I know my Landlord will sell this house and I need to know I’ll be able to find a place for myself too 

She also isn’t the only person who owes me money.

I know that I can’t save everyone and it’s problematic to try to, but I wouldn’t choose to let her become Unhoused, but I’ve suggested different things to her that might help in the past and she won’t apply for some of them. She deserves to have a good life without being as stressed. I think I feel like an asshole because I have money and shouldn’t I keep giving it to people? There’s people who give everything they have to people and I feel like I’m complaining

Update: she’s willing to work with me on budgeting, so hopefully this helps

When my mom was coming to pick me up, I took the bags of clothes to donate to my car. My roommate asked if I could take her bags of clothes to throw out. She was flying home and couldn’t take them herself. I asked her if she meant donate. She shook her head no, saying that these clothes “were personal” to her and she didn’t want to know other people were wearing them. I rolled my eyes but said sure.

When I got home, my little sister (16F) asked to go through the clothes before they were donated. I said yes. That afternoon, I took all of the bags of clothes to be donated — including my roommates. I figured she’d never know, and what she didn’t know wouldn’t hurt her. 

Anyways, flash forward to now. She comes to visit. My sister is wearing her shirt. Roommate recognizes it but says “Oh, I used to have it”. Sister spills the beans that it was from the bags of clothes. Now my roommate isn’t talking to me because she said her clothes were special to her and she wanted them thrown out. 

I don’t think it’s that deep, and I don’t think it’s okay to throw out perfectly good clothes.

AITA for exposing some of my siblings aggressive tendencys to my grandmother.,6,156wlg9,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156wlg9/aita_for_exposing_some_of_my_siblings_aggressive/,4,"AITA for exposing some of my siblings aggressive tendencys to my grandmother.

My brother (m17) and father have been having issues for years. They argue loudly. 

 My dad doesn't really do a good job of deescalating the situation at all. I've tried to intervene throught the years but it normally just ends up with something of mine broke.

One will start yelling and the other will egg the other on for hours. My brother has broken several tv's around 5. Put holes in several doors. And several crushed phones. 

The most recent argument brother left to live with his grandmother whos honestly out of the loop and just hears my brothers side of the story. My dad locked the doors to the house so he couldn't come in alone.  in fear of my brother doing more damage. 

My grandmother this morning called me to let him in the house to pick up his stuff. She told me ""its so awful of your dad to lock the doors."" And I told her what my brother has done over the years with breaking stuff. Including a $500 tv i had gotten for my dad as birthday gift. I had insurance on the TV then he also broke the replacement. 

My brother is upset that i told her because he doesn't want her to think ""badly"" of him. 

By no means is my dad a saint alot of the fights are caused by them both equally. But he is the adult in the situation and gets angry with him quickly. My brother does intentionally try to anger him though. He has said purposely racist and sexual things infront of my father that makes him uncomfortable and when asked to stop my brother just increases the volume of comments for example. 

Many time if my brother thinks he can do something to inconvenience my dad he will. 

I feel like she should know what she's getting into letting him in her house. Between breaking stuff shoplifting alcohol and being hyper aggressive when he doesn't get his way.",1690063161.0
AITA for saying the font on my aunt's church website was hard to read?,2,15733xc,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15733xc/aita_for_saying_the_font_on_my_aunts_church/,10,"I (49F) recently moved from NYC to Columbia, SC, for several reasons, mainly for my three youngest since I'm divorced and couldn't afford a better place in NYC. Since I work remotely as a Web Development Project Manager, I packed up the kids and started to settle into our new home.

I knew there might be some issues with the transition, as a liberal atheist in the South, but I'm not trying to convert anyone to my way of thinking. I figure living my best life without judging how anyone lives their life tells you everything you need to know about me.

I chose South Carolina because my father’s family lives here, my older daughter is in Charlotte, and my sister is in Savannah. It takes a village, right? I’m an older single mom and like the company of me, myself, and I--but I wanted the children to know their uncles and aunt, who are in their late 70s and 80s. 

So, my aunt called me up today and, right off the bat, asked me if I go to church. I tell her, no, and neither do the children. I left it at that because I know that seniors need their jesus, and really, I don’t care. She wanted to invite the children to a youth event at her church next week. I’m not interested as most of these things are indoctrination events, but to be polite, I asked her to text me the flyer.

She said the church website would have the information, and I could find it there. I review, train, and build websites for a living…even started a freelance web development business. I have been doing this kind of work for fifteen years. Church websites can be the worst: bad design, overloaded content, autoload videos…so my expectations were pretty low. I just wanted to print out the flyer to ask my boys if they might be interested in going.

Honestly, the site wasn’t that bad…though I have a high tolerance for bad websites. All the navigation links were uppercase, the banner images weren’t properly formatted, causing the text to be cut off, and way to many sub-links, often leading to the same page. Plus, I couldn’t find the event flyer or the page it might be on immediately. So the UX is pretty bad but not pure trash.

I told my aunt that the font of the website is hard to read, and she said, “Don’t criticize my church.” I explained that I wasn’t criticizing her church, just that the website could use some work. She got offended and said that professionals did the site, and it was just fine.

After a few more minutes of looking, I finally found the flyer with more hard-to-read text. I tell her that maybe I’ll come with the children and give my card to the site admin to offer my services. She proceeds to uninvite the children and hung up on me. 

I think my aunt owes me an apology for her un-christian-like behavior, but my sister thinks I should have kept my thoughts on the website to myself. I said the font was hard to read, not that her potato salad was too salty. AITA for talking about her church website?",1690080937.0

We ate and afterwards I put our sons to sleep and I cleaned up my sons high chair and swept the area we ate and then I washed all dishes including the ones used to cook with.

They have since recovered, but we hang out multiple times a week and I've been noticing they always go to the bathroom right after meals and run the tap for a while. I think that they might be making themselves throw up, I am not 100% sure but their history with it as well as the pattern I've been noticing make me very worried about them.

I feel like it would be wrong for me to stand by and do nothing, but I am also not sure who to talk to or tell. My friend and I are very close but I've always been wary of asking them about her disorder/recovery since it was a really tough period and it's also a really personal matter. My fear is that if I asked them directly about it, they'd cut me off or just deny it and I wouldn't be able to do anything.

The best option in my opinion is to tell their parents, but that kind of feels like going behind their back and not even giving them a chance to talk to me about what I've noticed and explain their behavior. I asked a friend who has struggled with the same type of disorder for advice and they advised me to not mention it at all because in their experience, any outside intervention didn't aid in their recovery.

My friend thinks this makes him a genius and brags about how it’s evidence he’s smarter than Americans that only know English. Honestly, I don’t see it that way— he’s not trilingual because he’s smarter than Americans, he’s trilingual because he’s from a country where he’s surrounded by three languages from birth. In those circumstances, most people could— and as seen by other Lebanese people, do— pick up all 3 languages. It would actually be impressive if he learned two languages from scratch instead of just picking them up due to environment.

I told him that it just makes him look like kind of a douche to brag about being trilingual when it really has nothing to do with his intelligence, so he should probably stop. I half told him because he’s my friend and I don’t want him to make bad impressions on people, and half because he’s getting on my nerves.

He got angry and said that I was an AH and just jealous of how obviously smart he was. I told him that no, I just don’t think it’s that impressive to be trilingual when you’re born in a country where everybody is.

And the disabled toilet was its own private bathroom and not just a stall in the other bathrooms. 

I was at the theatre last night and during intermission I headed to the toilet. As I was heading to the accessible toilet there was a woman in front of me also heading in that direction. She got there before me so I had to wait outside. A man saw this happen and made a comment about the woman being wrong for using the accessible bathroom when she was able bodied. So I said “we don’t know this woman,  she could have a million valid reasons to use this bathroom” and he left. 

here’s the issue: when the woman came out of the bathroom she looked at me with my stick and started shouting at me for not letting her know that I was behind her and that I made her look bad for making a disabled person wait for the bathroom. I said “I don’t really care. Id just like to use the bathroom please”.  But she carried on calling me selfish and manipulative for purposely letting her use the bathroom before me in order to make her look bad. i just ignored her and went into the bathroom.

I don’t feel like i’m TA because who am I to judge whether she’s “allowed” to use a certain toilet. Because whether she was disabled or not, the line for the women’s bathroom was absurd and I don’t blame her for not wanting to wait in it.

AITA for Taking the Car,1,1576t9o,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1576t9o/aita_for_taking_the_car/,12,"Some backstory:  
I am 18 years old and got evicted from my apartment with my abusive mom last January. I moved in with my best friend Casey, her and her dad were very welcoming for me to come and live with them which I appreciated more than words can describe.   
Last summer I was having to either lyft or take the bus to work the majority of the time and Casey's dad, Gerald, gave me his card and said I can use it to lyft or uber whenever I needed. When school started for a while my bf's mom was able to take me, but towards April stopped being able to, so I started using the card to go to and from work and school.   
In May, Gerald calls me and says he needs me to pay back the lyft and uber charges and to stop using the card so I do as he says and I stop. He said he wants me to pay him back and do some work for him. I've been asking about the work he wants me to do for him for the past few weeks and he keeps saying he needs something else and needs me to pay him. Unfortunately, I am going to college next month and that has resulted in a lot of  money I've been having to put in so I pushed back the first payment to this upcoming wednesday.   
This leads me to the issue of the cars. Casey said in December when she was on a trip her dad that I could use the car when I only had my permit. I will admit this was totally 100% on us and we should not have done that so when her dad found out he was kind of mad, but only talked to Casey about it and not me and I have not taken the care since.   
Now this is where the AITA really comes in, I got my license on wedesday and I asked Gerald if I could use his car he said it would be okay. The next day after that my boyfriend was at my house and his mom who is abusive starts to get mad and is demanding him home then, I had called Gerald three times and only one of them went though, assuming it would be okay (bad idea), I took the car for 25 minutes to take home my boyfriend and fill up the car with the gas I had used over the two days.   
When I get home he asked where I was and I told him I took home my boyfriend and he says we will talk later, so I called him this morning and apologized and said this was totally my fault and it would never happen again, as I'm moving in two weeks anyway. He says I am to never take the cars again and he will not provide transportation for me to go to work. Mind you I had apologized truly four times by now, and the last time I was crying, which I didn't mean to do to make him feel bad I just couldn't help it. He told Casey's sibling that I need to understand the consequences and that my abusive mom never taught me them so he will, and that I was out joyriding the car and doesn't think I tried to contact him before going and I need to pay him back now. I have mentioned I need the car to go to work as I cant pay for lyfts and bus fares and pay him back and that getting to use the car for work is important and he says I need to figure it out.

AITA for telling my friend her boundary’s over my other friend are stupid,1,1576sw7,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1576sw7/aita_for_telling_my_friend_her_boundarys_over_my/,3,"Me (14F) and my friend, Taylor (14NB) have been close for a while and are in a friend group with another mutual friend. A year ago I introduced Becky, (12F) to them. Becky was my friend and had expressed her desire to get a DnD group going, I know Taylor had played DnD before and are other friend wanted to, so I introduced them. 

Becky was a little hard to deal with, she got mad over small things (like us getting sidetracked for a little while playing DnD). But she was younger then us and in turn more immature, and that was ok. We all were the same in 6th grade and we’re all immature in are own right. Other then small fights nobody really had a problem with her, we welcomed her into the group and I loved all of them. 

Sense then she’s grown so much, she’s mature and doesn’t get mad easily, and when she does she communicates about what she’s upset about rather then ignore us. I’m really proud of her. Of course with her becoming older she’s also becoming cooler and her own person. She started not talking to us as much, which I was fine with. She has her own friends and her own life, she’s in a different grade level and is developing her friend group and who she is. I didn’t take her not talking personally, and I didn’t let her attention define my self worth. But Taylor had a issue with it.  

Honestly I dont really get why, they were never close and didn’t really talk much. Becky was the closest to me so I had a mindset that if it doesn’t bother me then why would it bother Taylor? I realize now that me and Taylor are different people and my triggers arnt the same as there’s. Taylor was PISSED at Becky, they said that they felt Becky wasn’t putting effort into there friendship. I thought that was stupid, and honestly I feel like If Taylor wasn’t so insecure then Becky being distant wouldn’t bother them, especially becuase they weren’t close at all. 

I’ll try to shorten it becuase this is turning out to be really long, Taylor wanted to completely cut off Becky, without even telling Becky what she did wrong. Me and the other friend in are group agreed this was extreme and I thought this was honestly selfish. I love are friend group and I don’t want it to be broken apart by something so dumb. Becky didn’t even know she did anything and who cares if she isn’t giving you enough attention?? I voiced my options to Taylor after they told me to stop inviting Becky to things and Taylor said I wasn’t respecting there boundary’s over Becky. 

I think her boundary’s are stupid and could be solved if they talked. Sense then Ive apologized and said they can do what they want. We’ve reconciled but I’m still wondering.. AITA? I feel i may have been insensitive, if so what should I do to make it up to Taylor?",1690092805.0

Rave and I are very close, so we try to plan to hang out whenever we can because he only lives 15 minutes away from me. Although..here’s the thing:

For the most part, Rave has a tendency to oversleep, forget about or change our plans. It’s a very typical occurrence and it’s very rare that we stick to the original schedule. I’ll list some examples here: 

- Rave and I once agreed to meet up at a restaurant for lunch, but he never ended up showing up. After I left in frustration, he texted me that he slept through his alarm, his phone was dead and was on his way but I was already frustrated and told him to forget about it because he made me wait 3 whole hours with no contact from him.

- On several accounts, we had planned to go to the mall only for him to oversleep and act like everything was normal before profusely apologizing that he forgot about our plans because he stayed up playing Smite all night long and didn’t go to bed at the right time. EVERY TIME. 

- Recently, he invited me to an amusement park under the assumption that his aunt would not be attending. (According to what she said to him, ‘allegedly’) He spent weeks telling me I was capable of coming only to take back his statement THE MORNING OF that she had “suddenly changed her mind” and he “decided to rebel by not going because I wasn’t able to.”

There’s more, but those are for another time.

The situation I’m dealing with right now: We were supposed to go to the beach today, and we had planned this maybe 4-5 days ago. Well, it’s literally 30 minutes before we’re supposed to go and I haven’t gotten dressed or anything because he hasn’t responding to my efforts to contact him to confirm our plans. I’m just so frustrated because this happens almost all the time to which he changes the day and we go then (rarely) or he just oversleeps and says the same ‘apology’ all over again.  

After being promised to do something I’ve been waiting all summer for, I got a little ahead of myself and wrote him a frustrated message. I told him he didn’t actually seem to care about hanging out with me regardless of how much he talks about it because if he did, this stuff wouldn’t happen. I said I was disappointed and that I wasn’t going to be responding for the rest of the day since this was a waste of my energy and time.

Mom (53F), Dad (53M) + me (17F) moved to Aus when I was 3. Grandma (74F) is Dad’s mom, 'Lora'. She has 2 other kids, including 'Jen' (48F). Lora has always been a difficult person. Jen+Lora especially never had a good relationship. Lora never thought Jen was good enough and told her that throughout her childhood. Bio grandpa passed 10ish years ago. She remarried to 'Tim' 9 years ago. Jen’s marriage failed due to her cheating so she moved in with Tim+Lora. Lora was resentful, passive aggressiveness from both. Tim died 1.5 years ago. There was 2 months where we financially supported Lora+Jen since they weren’t getting Tim’s pension. At least $2k, no gratitude from Lora/Jen. After the pension restarted we sent $400 every month so they can be comfortable. (My family is stable, but we aren’t super rich)

Mom went to visit all fam/friends 1 year ago and noticed Lora+Jen have wasteful habits. After this, my parents said to keep sending money they would need to tell us any major decisions. It was fine until July. Lora got $20k from Tim’s death, Jen bought a $15k car for herself. They hid it from my parents. Dad was upset, said that they need to sell it and he would not be sending money. Jen+Lora blew up and then didn’t answer any calls/texts for 2 weeks. Mom was stressed about their safety so sent someone to check on them. They said L+J were ordering expensive takeout and had not sold the car. After this Lora called Mom crying, saying she wasn’t being fed and they were using all her money. Mom organised someone take Lora to the bank to open a seperate account. Lora then said that she would only agree if we move her to Aus since she is sick of Jen, Jen said we needed to pay her for time/petrol to drop Lora at the airport. We cannot afford to pay to bring Lora over (100k+) so she said that we didn’t love her, that Dad was a horrible son, etc. Dad said he was done with them.

**This is where I am probably the asshole.**

Lora called me, saying that I have a job and that she was abandoned, that I need to give her money for food. I told her *""I hope you starve. I’ll never send you anything, leave us alone""* and hung up. She didn’t call me again. I told Dad what I said and he texted her saying not to contact me.

I told Mom how upset I am at them for creating these issues, and how I don’t love them or view them as family. My mom said she understood where I am coming from but that they were still family. She said even if they said all these horrible things + used us for money if they called saying they were starving she would help. I told her I said I didn’t care if they starve. She said I was insensitive, Lora is being manipulated by Jen and is very vulnerable. I said it is her own fault treating Jen badly during her childhood and that I hate them both. A bit later Mom said what I said was rude and she won’t be telling me anything else about the situation if I am going to go around saying that to Lora+Jen.

Our conversations feel forced, it's like he puts on an act whenever he's with me.

I get that we come from different backgrounds, he has to be more careful of his image because he comes from a well-off family, though it upsets me that he's thought of me as someone he can't be real with.

I try my best to have better conversations with him and show him the real me too, but whenever I do that I face nothing but pity or...how should I say this... It's almost like he looks down on me.

One of the things that really bothered me was when we were hanging out outside a convenience store one time, I told him I'd be dropping out of college for now to focus on the full-time job I got. It was my dream job and he knew how much I needed to save money as well. 

I know I shouldn't expect people to behave a certain way, but when he just laughed and said ""another break?"" (or something along those lines) I could sense the way he looked at me. I just laughed it off and he never really spoke much after that.

(Yes, I did take a break during high school too, that was due to financial problems but thankfully I did graduate.)

After that, whenever the conversation comes up to my mind again I just brush it off and pretend it didn't happen, it was only one time and I thought he was just worried about my education, which I appreciate.

But then it kept happening, whenever we hung out I could hear his siblings talk about my ""old"" clothes and how they'd never wear something like that (which my parents worked so hard to buy for my birthday years ago) or how his parents (mostly auntie) would constantly tell me that ""people like me"" should go back to college even though I told them not to worry and that I had a plan.

and how he'd always laugh when I try to treat him to something with my own money and say: ""between the two of us, I think it's clear who needs it more."" (something along those lines)

I don't even know why he keeps me around anymore. It didn't use to be this way, I don't understand why it happened so fast since we graduated high school.

Long story short, I was invited to an event along with a new friend I just made from work. She's really been nice to me and I thought it'd be good for my mental health to be surrounded by new people once in a while.

So, I accepted it. I was thinking of bringing him along because we basically always go to events together no matter what, but now, it's been months since we went to one and I'm still wondering if I'm even his friend anymore.

If he finds out that I went to a new place with a new friend without him, I'd be scared to be accused as someone who ""betrayed"" him or snuck behind his back again. (Believe me this has happened when I hung out with new people before)",1690092596.0

I (37f) have a (34f)pregnant friend of the friend  group we will call Beth.  So me and Beth really have never been close, I've always found her very self centered.  Example we will be having very serious conversations like one time I was talking about my best friend's husband who was literally on hospice care and dying of cancer to our mutual friend we will call Jen and she interrupted us mid talk as I'm catch Jen up on the situation so she can inform us her bf kid fakes throwing up in the morning so he doesn't have to go to school.   She also has to one up every one.  Jen had one time asked me about my powerlifting and how good I look post covid lockdown because I lost 30lbs she interrupted once again to inform everyone she's lost 100lbs, over 5 years ago post lap band surgery,  and she was thinner than me and weighed lest than me so clearly I wasn't do that good of a job with my weightlifting journey.  I'm laughing thinking about this cause it just sounds stupid to me she thought any of that was a valid point.   Any way her and her current fiancee we will call Billybob(34m) have been together since 2019, during the 2020 lockdown Beth was the only one of the two working supporting him and his son from a previous relationship, and she could only afford the lot rent or internet bill that month.  She decides having a home is more important than the internet.   Internet gets cut and words happen because he couldn't get onto the internet to talk to his ""Xbox girlfriend"" hes had instead of going out and getting a job he was having an emotional affair.  We of course all supported her leaving him and moving on.  Two weeks later she tells us all on a zoom call, still pandemic lock down, they are working things put and he won't cheat again.  I tell her you do you but I won't support the relationship.   Flash forward today.  Billybob hasn't been the greatest to her, he puts her down constantly and his son from another relationship who is 7, he is constantly telling him to not listen to Beth as she isn't his mother.  Like she will make dinner and the kid won't want to eat what she made and go eat junk food and she can't tell him no and Billybob let's him do whatever.   So she is almost 9 month pregnant, I did not go to her shower, and a few of my friends told me to give in and make her a blanket so I don't look like an ahole.  Backstory about my blankets every baby I've made them for has been healthy and every wedding I've made them for couple is still together so there is now a superstition from other people about them being good luck.

My mum is not happy with her current life. She has gained a lot of weight, and is insecure (even though she doesn't admit it). She is also highly educated (M.Comm) and honestly, deserves to contribute to the financials of the house. Especially now, after my grandfather retired, since my father is the sole breadwinner of the family.

There's also the fact that despite there being 2 housemaids and another homemaker, she ends up being the one that does the most work. It is unfair to her and if she is unable to do the work, the two people that are actually getting paid for their jobs will DO them.

Now this is where my frustration comes in. Since she has practically no life of her own, she invades mine. She is controlling and wants to make (almost) everything personal to my life flow according to her decisions. I am extremely firm about my boundaries and limits and my mum thinks I am not only disrespectful, but also secretive with something to hide. She thinks I'm gay because I hangout with 'gay-looking' friends (what ever that is supposed to mean) and so much more. 

One day, when she was yet again invading my private life, I snapped and told her about how she really needs a job. It is exhausting with her trying to control my life because she feels out of control with hers.

She and my aunt (don't even get me started on her: shes a karen) think it was highly disrespectful and that she is just worried about me. I explained that often I find parents that work being more open-minded not only because of the exposure they get to diversity, but also because they just start caring less about the intricate details of their private life.

They did NOT like that. I dont know what offended them? Especially my mum, since she actually wants a job?

At the beginning of this month, I turned 17, it isn't one of those birthdays that's super important in my opinion so I was more than happy with keeping things chill.

 But my mom came up to me with a 'surprise', that being the fact she, along with my aunts and two cousins, had planned to go on vacation! At first, I was super excited, I'll be visiting somewhere I've never been before! I was really happy until my mom told me the dates we planned to travel- the final weekend of July. My smile dropped rather quickly and when my mom asked why? I reminded her that I had blocked off that weekend with plans already. 

What plans you might be asking? I bought the weekend pass to attend a convention with my friends that weekend. I had bought an early bird badge mind you, my mom helped me purchase it a few months back. I also planned to use whatever money I had to buy two tickets to a concert that same weekend. My FAVORITE band is gonna be in my area that same weekend- and when I say they're my favorite band I mean I was in their top 0.1% of Spotify listeners last year- So it's safe to assume I was very vocal about my weekend plans to everyone in my family.

My mom told me it had slippered her mind when they had made the plans, and since the tickets hadn't been purchased, she would try to convince my aunts to change dates. And since you're reading this post...You guessed it they did not listen. I had to get a refund for my badge three weeks before the con. I was upset especially when I broke the news to my friends. But no harm done, I can always go to another con later this year or wait until next year. 

The reason I feel like an a-hole now is because our trip is set for this upcoming week and I'm not excited. I got over the fact I'll be missing the con, but the concert. I'm literally tearing up thinking about the fact I was so close to being able to see a group that changed my life so much, and it just slipped from my grasp. I'm so tempted to lash out at my aunts and mom for not being sympathetic to the fact they completely trampled over my parade. But I know it'll come off as me being spoiled and entitled. 

I am so grateful to be able to be given this opportunity, but does that mean I have no right to be upset? Also before anyone comments, my aunts didn't put anything into my travel expenses. I don't like the fact they advertised this as a gift for me when it feels like this is more for them than me.

So I ask you, am I the a-hole?

I've been trying to provide for our household and try to earn more to raise two kids on as all our money goes towards bills and clothes and food, not much else.

We live with each other because we were long-distance for the first few months, but I own a condo, so if he were moving across the country, it would be easier to live here and not pay rent.

I have not been on vacation in 5 years and would like to take one with my family. I have had to miss out on several family trips over the past five years because I was studying for the LSAT, in school, or had summer employment, and now I’ve been studying for the bar for 2-3 months, and my family scheduled a vacation, and I want to go.

I initially invited him (my dad would have pay for him), but he declined and is mad at me for going. He believes it is childish for me to go on a family vacation, and I should have asked my dad to give us money to go on our own vacation. I think that would be a bizarre thing to ask my dad.

He told me I could enjoy my vacation, but he would not talk to me while I’m there. While I’m gone for 1 week, he will watch my dog and his cat. He demanded I give him shopping money. I was going to give him $200, but he laughed and said it wasn’t enough (as if he hasn’t had a free place to live for seven months). He suggested he may cheat when I’m gone and that he will go out drinking every night because he doesn’t want to be alone. 

In his defense, he has been helpful while I’ve been studying. He has helped clean a lot around the condo and has helped with my dog. I think he’s sacrificed a lot of time with me to allow me to study and be supportive, which is why I invited him to the vacation. 

I guess I’m ranting, but I’m upset because I feel like I’ve put in 5 years of hard work and would like to enjoy some time with my family, and it’s already ruined. Is it actually ridiculous for me to go on vacation with my family at 25? Especially taking into account that he has been mostly helpful while I have studied.",1690038645.0

I'm currently in the process of finalizing the guest list (I will be inviting guests from overseas, so I'd like to give them ample time to make travel arrangements). There's one name that remains a big fat question mark as to whether I should extend the invitation or not.

A bit of background: Joe has been married twice before. I've met both of his exes and get on very well with them. This other woman - I'll call her Rhea - is my partner's former business partner. I've met her a few times, but we never really clicked. Not long after Joe and I moved in together (over a decade ago), I found out that Rhea had offered him some money (idk what for, we both work full-time and are financially stable) on the condition that he never mention it to me. He didn't accept the money, but I was not very happy to learn about this and subsequently told Joe that Rhea wasn't welcome in my house.

A few years after this, Joe got a call from Rhea informing him that she was making a last-minute visit to the city where we lived and needed a place to stay. He offered her our guest room without consulting me. I was *pissed,* but tried to be civil. During this visit, Rhea completely lied and told Joe that she had apologized to me about the money thing and that she just didn't understand my beef with her, like she's somehow a victim here. She's just a weird person who lies for no reason and I don't like her. I understand that she and Joe have been friends for a long time and I don't mind that; I just don't particularly want to be friends with her my own self.

Everyone else (men and women) I've talked to agrees that Rhea likes to cause drama for the sake of it and could cite an example of her doing something similar to them, so it isn't just me that she behaves like this to.

Her absence from Joe's birthday would be a noticeable one. I really don't want her there trying to start some bullshit with me or the other guests, but I'm worried my dislike of Rhea will put a damper on Joe's special birthday.

WIBTA for using my backpay on my medical expenses?,1,1576f3g,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1576f3g/wibta_for_using_my_backpay_on_my_medical_expenses/,9,"Hi everyone, I am writing this because I am heavily leaning towards giving my carer’s payment backpay to my partner’s mother, but I am second guessing this because I have a long history of people-pleasing.

For context, my partner’s mother cares for her younger autistic child full time and studies part-time, whilst trying to formulate a plan to leave her toxic ex. She has whole-heartedly accepted me into the family and is a very kind and caring person. She also lives with unmanaged adhd and pours her heart into one activity after another, and this impulsivity sometimes means that money burns a hole in her pocket (such as her current low key addiction to getting online shopping deals on often unnecessary items), though this is often in the pursuit of frequently giving others thoughtful gifts such as herbal treatments for their ailments or utility items.

In March I filed for a carers payment since I now care for my partner. Their mother suggested it because she said she will receive the same payment caring for her younger child and my partner moved out. This would be much higher than my current payment and I just received the difference between the two in backpay now that it has been approved.

My partner’s mum was given a large debt as a result of this and also just got diagnosed with a fast-spreading form of cancer, that can be easily stopped if it is excised almost immediately. I offered to pay for her to see a private specialist and get it removed asap with some of the backpay. She declined and wanted to get it done almost two months from now at the local hospital. I did not agree, but it was her choice. She also asked me to give her the full amount of backpay to cover some of her debt and her child’s expenses. I asked her to tell me roughly what she would need in the immediate for me to consider.

On the other hand I have recently been in financial stress and couch surfing and only just found a temporary living situation sharing a room with reduced rent in return for housekeeping. I am medically disabled and currently unable to work. Getting the necessary treatments and therapies would be life changing, but I can only afford some of them and the money could go towards saving for them and other important expenses. 

I am very conflicted because my relationship with my partner’s family is very good (I am low contact with my blood family for personal reasons) and I would feel terrible their younger brother had to go without anything.

This is a touchy subject for me, considering I have a family member with this diagnosed disorder. We quickly learned however that this was only brought up because of an online quiz he took. It all unraveled from there. While arguing about it, he revealed he was never diagnosed with autism or depression or ptsd, but was “sure this is what he was dealing with and didn’t need a doctor telling him what he was”. 

I got frustrated and told him that he needs to see a doctor before claiming these things about himself and he told me that I was an AH for telling him he was faking his disorders.

The first problem I had with him was a couple of months ago when I used the Walmart app, and it didn't load correctly. He snatched my phone and said not to use the app, the paper receipts are fine, to go and get my ""damn phone fixed"", and that he never wanted to see it again. I got mad, so I talked to customer service. They talked with him I guess, I don't know, but he's been much ruder since then, and I've been less polite in general with him.

A couple of days ago, I checked out again with the online receipt because it's just more convenient for me and everything was working fine. When he came to check it, I figured it's just a few things and is a short receipt, so he didn't need to touch it. He kept trying to, and I said ""please don't touch my phone, I'll zoom it in for you"" and ""hey I said don't touch my phone"". In kind of a rude voice. 

As I was walking away, he kind of mumbled that I was a ""worthless bitch"", in earshot of my mom. 

She got really upset and left before I could react. Honestly, to begin with, I really don't like the guy, and I was angry and wanted to get him into some trouble for embarrassing me.
So, I went to customer service again, and told the manager what he said, and how it's almost every time he is inconveniencing me, and I dont appreciate being talked about that in front of my family.  He seemed serious, so I'm wondering if I shouldve just left it. 

The receipt checker guy was getting a talking to when I left. I haven't seen him on his shift since then. I fear he might have gotten fired. I wanted him to like get a write up or something, I don't know, but not fired. He's elderly and pretty shaky, this might be the only job he can get, and I might've put someone out of a job, or even housing for basically nothing. I knew I shouldn't've have said anything, I was just feeling prideful because my family was around. 

Please tell me honestly, am I the asshole for potentially getting an elderly man fired because he said something mean under his breath?",1690023515.0
AITA for wanting to be involved in my half-sisters life?,9,156rp6h,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156rp6h/aita_for_wanting_to_be_involved_in_my_halfsisters/,33,"Not too sure how else to title this but here we go: 

I (20M) am going to have a baby half-sister! She’s not born yet (due in September) but I want to be apart of her life. My mom (41 F) doesn’t want me to be, as I’ll be in contact with my dad. 

For some context, my parents are divorced, and my dad (45 M) has remarried to M (29 F), who is 6ish months pregnant. (My mom has not remarried but is in a committed relationship with A (42 M) 

The divorce was ugly, and for about three years I cut contact with my dad. About a year ago, I started to (tentatively) speak to him and his new wife again. Our relationship is amicable at best, and he does help me out with paying for school and things, so I’m ok with being low contact. My mom isn’t happy about it, but she doesn’t limit my contact and is just glad for the extra help with school. She does get upset when I spend pretty much any time with them outside of gaining something (ex: getting my car fixed) so the idea that I want to be in my half-sisters life is mind boggling to her. (She’s got no problem with the kid! She just doesn’t want me near my dad) 

Frankly, I just want to be near my half-sister because my dad isn’t the greatest at being a father. M is nice, and I think she’ll be a good mom, but she’s going to need help and I don’t think my dad will be able to help her as much as she needs. Plus, I think it’ll be nice to have a younger sister. 

I feel like I might an the AH because my mom is very against it, and doing so would be going against her wishes ie. “Betraying” her. 

TLDR: I want to be in my half-sister’s life, My mom doesn’t because I’ll have more contact with my dad. 

AITA?

Edit for clarity since some people have asked what he did: 
He cheated on my mom with his new wife (it’s how they got together) Disowned my older sister for ratting him out, caused us to lose the house we were in because he refused to pay the bills and tried to royally screw both me and my mom over in the divorce hearings (I don’t know the actually details, just that it was bad) and while he was not physically abusive, he’s pretty manipulative and has a tendency to yell a lot. Hence me wanting to help with my baby sister.",1690051071.0

We both work full-time yet I have taken the brunt of taking care of the girls this summer because I have the most flexible job.

I have not prioritized cleaning I’m gonna be honest, because I’m trying to manage their summer schedule as well as my work load. I spend one or two hours doing laundry on the weekends, which isn’t always something I’ll finish. He thinks I shouldn’t go out so much so I have more time to clean because he’s feeling like he’s already doing a lot in the home, which really feels unfair to me because he hasn’t had a load of the girls at all this summer so I feel like he is demanding same expectations . I’m kind of mom that does all these things because I want my girls to remember a beautiful summer. Yet I feel so unappreciated and basically like he’s calling me lazy. I still do the dishes on the days that he’s not able to and I still do the other demanda of the house like grocery shopping, but the fact that he feels like he’s caring too much because he’s been keeping up with more cleaning makes me feel so frustrated.",1690075060.0

WIBTA for intervening in my parents arguments?,1,1575egz,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1575egz/wibta_for_intervening_in_my_parents_arguments/,5,"I (20F) live in a house with my parents (48F/47M) and sister (22F). Our walls are paper thin and I hear just about every argument that goes on in the house. And Yknow, they happen a healthy amount, my parents seem to have a very good marriage overall.

But every now and then, there’s a big blow up. And pretty much every single time, it’s my Mom getting frustratingly overwhelmed by someone or something and my dad trying (and failing) to console her.

This time, it was my grandfather’s birthday and we hosted his party at our house. My grandmother (Mom’s MIL) has always been a bit of a stereotypical mean MIL to my mom. FYI, we are Mexican and I don’t speak Spanish, but my grandmother almost exclusively speaks Spanish, so I never really know what she’s telling my mom. But my mom always complains whenever my grandma is over that she’s giving her a hard time and is very rude and mean.

Now here’s the thing, my mom is a pretty emotional person (at least in my opinion). She cries easily when she’s overwhelmed and breaks down when she’s very stressed. I wouldn’t necessarily call it panic or anxiety attack level, but I wanna say she’s definitely more emotional than average.

Contrast to my Dad, who is very logical. Now idk if this might be an important detail, but I have long since had the suspicion that I am autistic and either one or both of my parents might be, especially my father because I basically inherited all of his traits. Logical, straightforward, and low-empathy. 

Every time my mom has this sort of big breakdown, my dad does a horrible job and consoling her, because he only ever offers counter-arguments, logical solutions, or insensitive comments. And he does this even regularly when he gets into an argument with any of us. He’s very much the type of person to debate about the correctness of someone else’s statement. Me, my sister, and my mom have all pointed out to him in the past that he never gives in to what we are telling him. He never just *agrees*, or accepts our statements as true.

With this recent argument, I could tell that my mom was getting fed up with his behavior, and told him that she was done being nice to my Grandma, all I could hear from my dad was him attempting to get her to be reasonable (in his mind). Through observing this sort of behavior for years, I’m tempted to intervene and tell my Dad that it doesn’t matter if he thinks thought processes should be a certain way, instead he needs to just accept what my mom is saying, and comfort her.

In my mind it’s so simple, and he just isn’t getting the hint, even though my mom just told him to his face, “You never agree”. But then I keep thinking, this is would be me getting into someone else’s business, which I’m not supposed to do. I don’t think their marriage is on the rocks, but I can pretty easily see this snowballing.

So would I be the asshole if I intervened and told my dad how to interact with my mom?",1690088222.0
AITA for Prioritizing My Great-Grandmother's Burial Over Driving Wife to the Airport?,37,156fvqh,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156fvqh/aita_for_prioritizing_my_greatgrandmothers_burial/,24,"For context, I regularly do the back-and-forth airport runs for my wife's work travel, which amounts to around 5-6 times a month. It's a 40-minute round trip, and fortunately, my flexible schedule allows me to accommodate these rides easily.  
  
This month, I had to be unavailable on two occasions. The first time was due to work meetings abroad, which only happen once or twice a year. The second instance was for a personal reason: my great-grandmother's burial. While I wasn't very close to her in the last few years, my mom had a deep relationship with her grandmother, and she asked me to attend the ceremony. I did offer to pay for a cab for my wife, just like I did the previous times when I couldn't drive her.  
  
However, my wife had a bad experience during one of those cab rides. She isn't fluent in the local language, which made it difficult for her to communicate with the driver, and the driver was rude, leaving her feeling scared, in tears, and anxious. Now, she's afraid of taking a cab alone and feels upset that I won't be there to drive her, expressing that I am ""always unavailable.""  
  
From my perspective, these kinds of events where I can't be there for the airport run happen very rarely, and I have been available countless other times. I believe my wife is being a bit selfish in expecting me to be at her disposal constantly, especially when it's a matter of attending a family burial.

She always had ""bad luck"" with guys and seemed to always come worst off afterwards. One of these relationships resulted in a little girl we'll call Ell. 
 
Within 4 weeks of meeting Sam they got engaged. However we were quick to discover that things were not as happy as they seemed. My partner and other female friends kept getting told of the constant arguments that were occuring, however, different people would get different information. These arguments did happen but were played down/up depending on who was spoken to. 

We had been aware for a while about the abuse and turbulence however it wasn't until recently that things came to a head. After Cara ditched her bridesmaids on her own hen do saying she had a family emergency only to be seen in a bar with her fiance and sister, the rest of the friends began sharing what they knew. 

It turned out Sam had threatened several of them (all women) as well as threatened Cara's daughter on several occasions. Each time Cara had played it down and begged for it to be ignored, video and screenshotted evidence was produced for most of these events. 

The biggest shock however was when Sam had told Cara that when they have kids they'd have no time to waste on Ell. AND SHE AGREED on film. This caused most of us to back out of the wedding. We did this politely with a wish to remain friends however Cara literally laughed, called all of us snakes and told us to never contact them again, afterwards her family did basically the same. 

A day or so later we hear that her nursery has opened up a complaint to social services regarding the safety of her daughter. As a group we decided to pool our videos and screenshots and submit them alongside this complaint as evidence of the hostile environment. 

We did this as a last ditch attempt to look out for Ell, who is the god daughter of my partner, however a couple of people said we should have left well enough alone. So I'm asking, are WE the arseholes?",1690056459.0
AITA for making a scene about driving?,3,156xrvc,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156xrvc/aita_for_making_a_scene_about_driving/,5,"Throwaway.

&#x200B;

I made arrangements to go see my (15M) cousin (14M). The arrangements were made way back in February. He lives in a city about 4 hours away and originally his dad was going to pick me up but things changed last minute and his stepsister(23F) came instead. (Let's call her Jane and let's call cousin Bob)

&#x200B;

Bob and I were going to see a movie the evening of which was at 6, so Jane came at 12 so we could be back around 4 or 5. Jane is on the spectrum but she's fairly independent and works, drives, etc. but sometimes does things a little differently or needs help.

&#x200B;

She has a habit of singing ""beep beep!"" if her car approaches another or vice versa, or if we brake. She makes this ""whoosh"" sound when merging or parking. She says it helps her focus. This is fine but once we hit a lineup, it was just ""beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep"" coming from Jane. She's saying that in a normal speaking volume, kind of laughing to herself about it, but nonetheless it's a bit irritating.

&#x200B;

At one point after we'd driven about halfway, she pulls over, just randomly pulls over to the shoulder, stays there for a few minutes, looks up the nearest rest stop, drives there, and just stays there for an entire hour. Not to nap or piss or anything, she just sits in the front seat - makes me get out - and whistles to herself. For an entire hour. 

&#x200B;

After 20 minutes of this I ask what's up, and Jane says that she's stressed and it's dangerous to drive when you're stressed. She's a very calm driver who doesn't have road rage afaik and I tell her that she'll be fine but we need to be there on time. She says I'm stressing her out more and she needs to be completely chill and focused before we can get back on the road.

&#x200B;

I admit that I made a scene because at this point we were going to be late and I already spent money on the ticket. But nonetheless I made a scene, and Jane shut herself in the car and sat there for another 30 minutes before we got back on the road but we drove in silence. I did tell her that it was more dangerous to literally just sit there than to drive annoyed. I told her that if she's THIS worried, maybe she shouldn't be driving. She literally pulled over again and sat there again. Just meditating.

&#x200B;

I've been here for three days and she seems okay but she doesn't want to be around us and whenever I enter the room she's in, she leaves.

&#x200B;

I do feel quite bad that I stressed her out but at the same it's kind of true, if you get that distraught maybe you shouldn't drive. But other than that, she's a really safe driver who takes every precaution and she's genuinely fun to be around.

We have 4 children, Giada(13f), Joey (10m), 6m, 4m (we also have a daughter that passed during birth). two from his previous relationship. My husband's previous relationship ended horribly. His ex left without saying anything. She drained their bank account and took everything, even things the kids had. She pretty much made them homeless. Kids were 8 months and 2 years old at the time.They haven't seen their mother since she left, she hasn't tried to get in touch with them. My husband hates ex and wants nothing to do with her. They never talk about their mom or ask, but they know they have a different mother. Giada's birthday was on July 6, ex sent a gift to in-laws house for her, along with a note for my husband.

He didn't want to read it, so he threw it away with the gift. I tried to get him to open it, but he wouldn't. I decided to open the note, and it said that she missed the kids, still loved them a lot, and wanted to apologize to him.As a mom, I felt terrible for her. I had postpartum depression and wanted to leave everything behind after I lost my daughter. I got the help and was able to deal with my grief. I don't know what made ex leave her kids behind, but I understand that she could’ve made this decision when she was mentally unstable. I know she's in the wrong for all she did to them, but I just wanted them to know that if they ever wanted to meet their bio mom, I would always back them and love them no matter what. I just wanted to know if they want to meet their mother, so I asked Giada, who is older and more mature.

I asked Giada if she remembers her mom. Giada said, I only remember you mommy Then I asked if she wanted to get in touch with her real mother and told her about the letter from bio mom. I told her whatever she chooses, I will always support her. She looked upset and told me I was her real mother. She asked why I would ask her that. I saw that she was upset and I told her that we didn't have to talk about it and asked her what she wanted to do that day. She ignored the question and told me that I am her real mom and the only mother she knows and has. She asked me if I was going to leave them and if her dad and I were going to get a divorce. She was crying, I tried to make her feel better by telling her that I would never leave her, her brothers, or her dad. She was so upset that she pushed me away and went to her room.My husband is understandably upset. I told him why I asked Giada that question and that I just wanted her to know that I back her no matter what she decides, but he is still very angry with me. He told me that until he calmed down, he didn't want to talk to or see me.   


I've already told Giada that I'm sorry and that I won't leave her, her brothers, or her father.Although I've apologized to Giada, I don't feel like the question I asked warranted this reaction from my husband. I did it because I thought it was best for the kids. AITA?",1690044631.0
AITA for asking when I'll get paid back.,3,156xr5y,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156xr5y/aita_for_asking_when_ill_get_paid_back/,3,"Hi, I am a 20-year-old female who is simply a fan girl. I usually save up a ton of money to spend on concert tickets and merch, and that’s basically all there is to it. My favorite K-pop group finally announced a tour in August and the tickets just recently went on sale for presale. I have been saving money from their last concert and am well prepared to spend the money that I need for a hotel, food, merch, and concert tickets.

Now let’s give a little bit of a background story. There is a girl, Lily (fake name), who I’ve been friends with since high school, me being a freshman and her being a junior when we first met. I have ignored the many red flags, but it is safe to say she is a Koreaboo and absolutely delusional. Lily just recently spent well over $8,000 to see her fav group as she went to every single concert in their USA tour, and completely believes that a member of the group is in love with her.

Moving on, the day the tickets dropped, I was able to get two VIP tickets for the two dates that my favorite group will be in Newark. With the additional fees, for two VIP tickets for one of the dates, the price was about $1,300. A lot. I know. And I paid for two days, so the total was about $2,600. Well, Lily expressed that she’ll pay me later, but she didn’t give me an estimate of when she’ll pay me back. Let me add that she bought $100 worth of tour merch that night.

Four days later I decided to text her asking if she’ll pay me within the upcoming week because I need to pay my credit card bill and wanted to know if I would have to pull out of my savings to cover it. Lily specifically said, “I can pay you now, just it’ll make things more stressful since I haven’t been paid yet”. Then said, ""you only have to pay off the minimum anyways. Realistically I can’t do it for another two weeks cause my bills get pulled from my next paycheck”. Ngl, I was a bit upset hearing that I would have to wait 2 weeks to be paid back as we’ve always been people who pay each other right away. However, I knew she was in the middle of moving so I expressed that I usually pay more than the minimum, but no worries, I will wait and pull out of my savings. She continues to say all of her savings went into the apartment and the rest is for movers, so she couldn’t do much. I replied, ""I completely get it, don’t worry”. Then bam, she sent the money for her tickets. I was so confused and expressed that she didn’t need to send it as I was simply asking. I said, “It’s my fault for asking. I’m sorry this is causing you stress. I genuinely was just asking” and I offered to pay her back. She replied “It’s fine, your timing just wasn’t good. I’m moving today and tomorrow so I’ve already been stressed this whole week, mainly today. I’m in a similar situation as you so I understand too much. I’d rather give it to you and not be anxious anymore than I already am. I just don’t want to be a burden to anyone, so it’s fine”.

This has been the most healthy relationship I have ever been in. He treats me so amazing. I have anxiety and tend to overthink a lot and he always helps me with it no problem. (I ofc am in therapy and take anxiety meds to help too). I’ve met his family and have spend a lot of time with them and they’re amazing as well. I have met his friends more than a few times and am even in their friend gc now. 

My bfs friend group are 3 women and 2 men. Kelly is married to Bob, Sophia is married to Cass. The issue started with Kelly. In the beginning she was so sweet and always texted me. She would talk to me about basically anything and it was going so well. They all have known each for a long time and don’t care if their s/o is texting another person as a friend ofc. Kelly’s husband Bob was the only one out of that friend group who tried to get to know me from a deeper level. Since I have a lot of trauma due to my toxic and abusive family. 

I would only text about whatever he asked. I rarely ever started the conversation. Ik some people do not like it when someone is texting their s/o so ofc I asked my bf if he thought Kelly was ok with it and he said yea he has plenty of female friends so she wouldn’t mind. 

I first started to notice that Kelly was acting distant with me when I started posting on my Facebook. She never liked any of my posts, but she used to and comment on them too. I did the same for her too. When she stopped I didn’t think anything of it, but I noticed from our mutuals she would still like their posts. 

Bob unfollowed me on Instagram and that was when I was questioning it more if something happened. I bought this up to my bf ofc and he said it was weird too. Since they’ve been friends for so long you’d think they’d bring up something if there was a problem. 

The last thing I noticed was that Kelly removed me and my bf from her private story. I felt really bad especially since my bf is so amazing and doesn’t deserve someone doing little petty gestures instead of communicating with him or me if there is an issue. 

Would I be the asshole if I confronted them or simply asked them if there is an issue? Also can anyone try to guess what the issue is? I never want to make anyone feel horrible or bad. I have been overthinking if I said or did something, but nothing comes to mind.

I do occasional petsitting with dogs. This time I got a dog with separation anxiety, which meant the dog couldn't be alone at any time, including at night. I made a mistake and thought the petsitting day was a day my partner was not in the house overnight as he would be working a night shift. However, the petsitting ended up being in a day my partner was sleeping in the house. My partner likes dogs but he sees dogs as an ""outdoor only thing"" and doesn't allow dogs to go into our kitchen or our bedroom. Of course, this is a problem, as the dog couldn't stay alone during the night, I had to sleep in the living room with the dog, and not in our bed.

The 2nd problem here is that we moved in recently to this house and we have nothing in the living room yet, i.e., no sofa! So I had to sleep in a small thin mattress, very uncomfortable, and also away from my partner, which I was really not happy about, of course, as to me this makes absolutely no sense.

We had a conversation about this and all he could say was ""I'm uncomfortable with dogs sleeping in the bedroom with me"". No reason, no explanation. Note that all it was needed was for the dog to sleep somewhere in the room on the floor in his bed. My partner was adamant that would not happen and I would have to sleep on the floor (with the thin small mattress) with the dog in the living room. He said at some point ""I feel bad you sleep on the floor, but..."" - i.e., he basically meant he feels less bad I sleep on the floor than if the dog sleeps in the same room as us.

This is both mine and my partner's house equally.

Also, at the start of our relationship, I was very clear I love animals and I intend to have pets and always have animals with me. He agreed and said he also liked animals.

We had a huge argument about this and I am now thinking if I am the AH or am I right in thinking this is not ok?

Additional info 1: Because this seems to be important for the judgement of the situation: When me and my partner met, I was really clear on the few deal breakers I have and which things are really important in my life. One of the deal breakers is being with someone that doesn't like animals and is not comfortable with them, since this is one of my passions in life and I have them around me often and want to have my own at some point in my house. When we were dating, he downplayed hugely his discomfort with dogs, telling me he had had a dog when he was a child and that he likes dogs and animals in general. He knew well that if he ever told me about this, I would not even have started dating him. When we were dating he was even meeting me for walks when I was petsitting, we got the dogs in his car often, he was good with the dogs and the dogs really like him.

Additional info 2: His boundary is only with the bedroom and kitchen where he doesn't want dogs to go in at all. But he never actually told me this when we dated! At some point he mentioned not sleeping in the bed, which is ok for me to live with. I only discovered this now because of this dog condition.",1690073705.0
WIBTA if I helped my best friend to rebuild his house after he treated my partner poorly?,6,156vdjc,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156vdjc/wibta_if_i_helped_my_best_friend_to_rebuild_his/,13,"I (21M) have been best friends with “Cody” (21M) for 6 years. We have been there for each other through thick and thin, although in the recent years, our friendship has been more on-and-off.

My partner “Chris” (22NB) and I have been dating for a bit over 2 years and we currently live together.

Chris and Cody used to get along pretty well in the beginning. They would joke around a lot, visit each others work places, and plan hangouts with me together. However, over the last year, Chris started telling me about how Cody would semi-ghost them, ignore their calls, and respond to their texts with one or two-word answers. It was around this time that Cody began treating me the same way as well, even going as far as calling Chris an alcoholic for a drinking problem that they used to struggle with. I did attempt to confront/reconnect with Cody a few times, only to be met with a lot of blame and deflection. After a few months of trying and failing to reconnect with Cody and being treated poorly, we both figured that his friendship with us was pretty much over.

Last week, Cody reached out to me to apologize for how he acted. He explained to me that he had been going through a rough time in his life, as his parents had just divorced, he had broken up with his ex, and his house had been damaged by a recent flood. I forgave him and proceeded to bring up what he had said about/how he treated Chris. He explained that he never had any ill-feelings toward Chris was just having a rough time. He then apologized to me for how he treated them.

Yesterday, I talked to Chris about how Cody and I made up. I brought up how I was thinking of helping him to fix up his house and asked Chris how they’d feel about it. While Chris didn’t explicitly tell me not to help, they made it clear that they were still hurt by Cody’s actions and wished that Cody would apologize to them directly.

My mom(36f) and my ""step dad""(36m) have been dating for about 4 years when this happened.

At the time I was 13 my dad had died when I was 3 due to a fire caused by chemicals at his work.After what happend to my dad my mom never really had it out to find someone new.Until let's call him cappy for privacy reasons and because their still together, came along. My mom and cappy got incontact 9 years after my dad's accident.I was devastated to hear that my mom found someone new,as I was always a ""daddy's girl"" but my brothers (9m) and (8m) were extremely excited to have someone new come into are lifes.

But before he came to are state he was in Ohio with a girl let's call Ashley they were together and she also had 3 kids I don't know their names or the genders but all I knew was that she had 3 kids.But they got into tons of arguments like my mom and cappy do now,they got into a big arguments and she locked her and her kids in a room and called the cops.After that he went to my state but at some point he had to go back to Ohio at some point for court which was a bigg red flag for me.

But cappy ended up moving in with us because he was in Texas living with his mom and that was to far away from my mom so he moved to are state and stayed with us.I kinda hated him from the start he did weed,smoked,got drunk and was over all so controlling I hated it.

A month after he moved in I'm kidding u not he and my mom got into arguments everyday he ruined are birthdays because of arguing,he ruined are Christmas arguing,he would also hit and beat my mom.he would go run to his brothers house every time they got into a fight.

This ended up happening for about 3 years and then we all moved to a bigger house 2 stories and overall very nice. Again they continued arguments. But one day I had enough. Like always they were fighting again and he was talking about my dad. That really pissed me off and lead me to my breaking point with him he went to hit my mom but I stopped him, I said ""don't u ever talk about my dad every again and don't you ever think that you'll be a father to me and mark my words say anything about my dad agian ill make sure your 6 ft under the ground and shut up before I call the police on you for trying to hit my mom(btw he was on probation which means if he got the police called on him or got intruble he would go to jail for 5 years) so he stopped and shut his mouth and just went upstairs to their room and didn't say a word to me for 3 weeks. I new he new I would find a way to do everything I said to him and he was scared I know it. My my got very upset at me when I would interfere with their fights she called me and a$$hole for interferingwith thier fights in the first place. I kinda think somethings she liked fighting but yk it Is what it is.

They still fight like cats and dogs he don't hot  her tho, and I'm just gonna let it go she'll realize what she is doing to are family but I did everything I could to help her but she would never listen.

When we arrived it turned out that one of my other freinds who was not hosting but also watching (27m) did not like vanilla coke, so I gave him one of the lime cokes. He was thoroughly satisfied with the lime coke.

Later that evening, the hosts sister wanted a coke and my wife asked if the vanilla coke that was left was for the hosts sister. I said i gave my wifes lime coke to him. My wife then ranted on me for assuming what kind of coke the co-watcher liked and that i should have asked her. She did not know what he liked either, so I have no clue how this would have helped.

AITA for expecting my wife to call out her sister?,6,156v8e8,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156v8e8/aita_for_expecting_my_wife_to_call_out_her_sister/,10,"My wife (F30) and I (M38) keep on clashing due to my inability to accept the behavior of her older sister Yvette. Every time I see her I get upset and need to vent with my wife afterwards.

Yvette is 12 years older than my wife, and their parents were already quite old when they had my wife. She acted as a surrogate mother, because their mother was not really able to do things with my wife. So they do not have a ""normal"" sibling relationship - if something like this exists at all. Anyway, Yvette keeps belittling my wife and often compares herself to my wife.

Example: when my wife, which does not drive that long herself, told me she made a dent in our car, Yvette jumped in and said she made her first dent as well last week, but only after driving for almost 20 years.

Another one: we live in the house of my family (European two-family house). The second time Yvette visitted, she had to mention how much fog there is in our valley, and that she would get depression. Also how small our garden is for a house. They rent a little house that is rather a garden house. Which is fine, but why trash talk my family home? We can live here much cheaper than market price. It is cristal clear that she is jealous. She has 4 kids and had them when she was quite young. She despises her man and treats him like shit. My wife has a better education than her, I have a better job and we are quite happy together.

And it gets ""better"". Our son broke his leg while being on Yvettes trampoline with his cousin (Yvettes son). First they didn't notice the fracture at the hospital, which is not uncommon for trampoline fractures on small children, but a few days later we had to check in again and they made an x-ray: the leg was broken and he needed a cast. When my wife told Yvette that his leg was broken, she questioned wheter it was a real fracture and if that really happened on her trampoline. Yeah, idiot, small children do not belong on trampolines, especially not with larger children!!! A few days later her teenage daughter visitted us and she asked again if it was a real fracture and if that really happened in their garden. So it was very clear what Yvette told them at home....

When I talk to my wife, it gets worse. She says that she doesn't see it that way. By all means, I love my wife for the good heart she has, but I boil when it comes to this topic. Worse than the behavior of Yvette is the fact, that my wife keeps taking her side and defending her. She says, that she doesn't see it that way and that she does not think it is negative what Yvette says. Sometimes she even says that she doesn't want to see Yvette this way. She really can't break away from her family and can't critize them at all.

I am no angel, I keep coming back to this topic, but in my eyes this is legit because Yvette keeps on being shitty.

So, am I the AH for talking bad about the sister of my wife and for expecting my wife to call her out?",1690059797.0

Most of them didn’t even know we were together romantically so they had some wild theories about why we were suddenly married. The most popular one was that I was pregnant so we had a shotgun wedding. I wasn’t pregnant before our wedding but I am now and I don’t want to announce it yet because I don’t want to deal with them thinking they’re right.

I especially don’t want to deal with one of my husband’s brothers because I think he was a dick when he found out we were married. He’s been leading the “she’s definitely pregnant” train and strongly implies that that’s the only reason my husband would marry me. I just know he’s going to be insufferable if we announce my pregnancy now.

I want to wait 2-3 months before we mention anything but my husband wants to tell everybody now. I’ve pretty much banned him from saying anything even though he thinks it’s not worth keeping a secret. We keep fighting because he wants me to change my mind but I won’t.

She said ‘No, do not bid’. But I was nervous as she had been outbid and I caught in the moment and started bidding on her behalf. I did not win the item and got sad and told my sister that I did not win. She went ballistic, as she had won the item, and I had just been putting the price up and bidding against her for the last five minutes of the auction.

To give some context to this situation I need to let you know what happened the first time. My husband and I lived in a small apartment and we let his mom stay with us temporarily while she sobered up from drugs and alcohol. I was fine helping but it changed as soon as she started stealing stuff from us and destroying some of my stuff. The first week she was there she drank ALL of our alcohol, which she wasn't allowed to have and was stored away where she couldnt get to it (obviously she did). And she went out almost every day and drank and did drugs with ""friends"". After like two weeks and a ultimatum she tried to sober up and ended up getting a job interview. But since she didn't have clothes I took her and bought her $200 worth of clothes to wear because she didn't have anything that wasn't ripped or painted on. After that she flipped her shit for no reason at me a few days  later when I picked her up from her job. As I picked her up she just bitched about how I'm not good enough for her baby boy and that I'm a peice of shit and that I need to get hit by a car and die. I tried to ignore it but it really hurt me and it didn't help that she destroyed my favorite pair of shoes and clothes from me without asking. I ended up crying by the time we got back to the apartment and she started throwing her stuff around and slamming doors and I couldn't handle it and I left and called my husband and told him what happened while crying my eyes out.

AITA for giving my granddaughter a nickname?,604,155urzq,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155urzq/aita_for_giving_my_granddaughter_a_nickname/,526,"When I first became a grandmother, I started the tradition of picking nicknames for my grandchildren. Most of my grandkids are now in their teens. I still call the teens the same nicknames I gave them as newborns.

There’s a WhatsApp group with me and my husband, our children and their spouses where we exchange photos and other updates. When my 9th grandchild was born, I was very excited when my son announced her name in the evening. I spent that night thinking what nickname she should have. It’s a very special moment for me. The following day, I greeted everyone in the WhatsApp group and announced the nickname I chose for my granddaughter and said I hoped they all loved it as much as I did. 

I nicknamed each of my granddaughters after a colorful fish species from my native language, not the English version.

My son’s wife immediately replied in the group text that they have carefully chosen my granddaughter’s legal name and everyone would be calling her that and the nickname I chose sounded too much like a name change instead of an endearing nickname. Admittedly, the nickname I picked has been consistently on the “top girl names” list in my language in the last 3 years so I guess it’s valid for her to assume it sounded like a name change but that was definitely not my intention.

My feelings were hurt. I didn’t reply anymore. Thankfully, my daughter saved the day by saying that I meant the gesture out of love and it has always been a special thing that I have a unique nickname for each of my grandchildren. Eventually that topic wasn’t brought up anymore. I’ve seen my son and his family a few times since and I only call my granddaughter her legal name.

However, my relationship with my son’s wife was never the same again. She used to take my phone calls and reply to my text messages. Since that day, she stopped answering my calls and would only rarely acknowledge my messages in the WhatsApp group. It has been 3 years. 

Somebody asked if I ever apologized for attempting to nickname my granddaughter and of course I didn’t think it necessitated an apology because: 1. I never insisted on using the nickname. 2. It was only my son and his wife who ever objected on me giving their kid a nickname. All my other children openly and kindly let me call their own kids the special nickname I decided on every single time and well into several years.

We finally got there and parked, by which point this entire endeavor has taken about an hour and a half+ of driving. Then, we walked over to the entrance to find a line.
This is not unusual- even years where I've arrived twenty minutes early there's a line. It is also plenty hot, but not even as hot as they expected and I'd told T to prepare
 However, once she saw the line, T refused to go in. Instead she began whining that she didn't want to wait, and that we should instead drive back home (another 45+ minutes drive), and that I could just drive back later. 
I texted a friend, who suggested a few options: leave her at a local mall we both enjoy while I go in, then pick her up again; buy her a bus ticket back (less than the gas, but unfortunately there weren't any intercity buses on weekends); or have one of her parents pick her up.

After the accident we had no choice but to let my grandparents bring us places.

My grandmother and I have a very strained relationship due to her not respecting my boundaries. For instance she would get in my personal space in public to smell me to check for body odor, or constantly be making comments on my appearance. She even once said “you don’t need boundaries on me I’m family” or “I only cross boundaries because I love you.” While crying (idk if it’s fake crying or not tbh)

Nowadays she’s criticizing how my apartment is and such. I’ve tried to ignore it best I can now that I haven’t relied on her. 

Now for the story. Yesterday I had to get my hair done as well as a few other things. During the car ride she was onto me about everything from telling my boss what was going on to getting a letter from the doctor. I had already told her that I was taking care of it but then she expected me to call the doctor in a restaurant. I politely asked her to stop and that I would take care of it but it continued on until we got to the grocery store.

That’s when I put my foot down and told her I had enough of her crossing my boundaries and got an Uber home, leaving her and my boyfriend behind. 

After all of this I don’t feel comfortable going to her 50th anniversary party. I know it’s special but I feel like actions have consequences and that if she would’ve respected my boundaries and stopped I would be more comfortable.

Now my family is calling me immature and saying family shouldn’t hold grudges against each other and that I need to celebrate my grandparents.

I found it very juvenile but funny and responded ""Oh man I wanted to hear Becca fart,"" which made the situation SUPER awkward. Everyone stopped laughing except for one woman who let out an awkward snort. They all quietly said ""Oh .. yeah"" and went back to work.

The air is completely different now (and I don't mean this as a fart joke). Every time I go into the office I'm treated very awkwardly.

AITA for insulting my ex,3,156wqq6,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156wqq6/aita_for_insulting_my_ex/,10,"Hello AITA, I never thought I would post here a day, but something is wheighing on my mind.
I'll try to brush over some details as to not invade the privacy of the people referred to in this post.

I was with a girl for 4-6 months, and it went well at the start. However, the more time went by, the more my ex made me have anxiety attack. (Treating me like shit for no apparent reasons, saying some really messed up things about herself, etc). I wasn't perfect either, as I was really jealous, cause she never said we were a thing to her main group of friends, and I would treat her really coldly when I was upset.

Finally, one day she told me she would go in ""reset mode"" and would probably not love me anymore. I tried to dispute that, but she was adamant it was almost sure she would lose feelings. She however didn't want to break up. My dumb self, being madly in love, went one week feeling sick to the stomach before breaking off. (She pretty much ignored it)

However, she started to spam me of message again once I broke off, and we went back together a week and a half later. We stayed together for 1-2 months, and then I broke it off again cause I felt more and more like shit in this relationship (even tho I was still madly in love). She again seems to not really care (maybe she was hiding it, and said that we would never get back together again (she told me that when we got back together).

On the other hand, she wanted to stay friends, and kept telling me some really disturbing things, treating me like shit (from my point of view), and telling how she would off herself if I would abandon her. 

One day after she gave me the silent treatment for several days after a dispute, I went mad and went to vent off my frustration to a ""friend"" (we were friend at the time).

That's the point of the post. To be quite honest, I was really tearing her up another one:
Saying she was dumb(cause she repeated a year in university, I know really douchy of me...), that I didn't needed her, that she never loved me, that she is just using me, that she was a touch wh*re. I was pretty mich unhinged that night, and just want full anxiety attack, crying like a baby while spewing atrocities.

Now, that friend decided that I wasn't his friend anymore,( pretty long story, but to sum it up he wanted to fuck me and didn't like I spent less time with him cause of my ex) and decided to say everything to his roommate who was in love with my ex.

She obviously was devastated by this, and went ballistic on me for obvious reasons.

Now I want to know reddit, Am I the Asshole for this?

TLDR: felt like shit in my relationship, I broke it off, we stayed friend, still felt like shit, so I insulted my ex to a friend and she came to know what I said",1690063508.0

WIBTA if I rewatched a show without my bf there?,2,156zj8z,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156zj8z/wibta_if_i_rewatched_a_show_without_my_bf_there/,11,"   So to start with, I'm a fan of the Netflix series Black Mirror, and I've watched all of the episodes, except the latest season thats been released. 

   Im not in a rush to watch the latest season in particular so I can hold back on it fairly well.   
   My issue though is that often when I'm working on something, I need to have some sort of show or movie going on in the background.

   A few weeks ago I suggested that when my bf and I finish watching Better Call Saul, which we're close to finishing, that we should watch Black Mirror after. He hasn't watched it as he's not a big show watcher. 

   I told him how I started rewatching the first season, and he got upset at me. He wanted us to start from the beginning of the series, meaning season 1 episode 1, together.

   I explained to him that I've already seen all the episodes already, and he still wanted me to refrain from rewatching it, in order to ""not freshen up my memory, to enhance my reactions."" Which.. I understand where he's coming from, but that show in particular is something thats hard to forget usually.

   Anywho, Im at a crossroads because I'm going to be working on stuff and I want to just have it play in the background while im working. I can even set it to where netflix doesn't auto start the next episode, JUST to ensure I don't accidentally start the new season.

  I know this probably sounds so dumb compared to other posts, I just want outsiders opinions on the whole, not rewatching it for the sake of his first time watching it.",1690070688.0

My (31m) gf “Sadie” (22f) has a daughter “Jo” (3f) from a previous relationship. The father isn’t in the picture. Sadie and I have been together officially a bit over 2 years. We got together when Jo was about 4-5 months, but I’ve known Sadie since a bit before she found out she was pregnant. 

Anyway. We moved in together over a year ago and Sadie works from home and keeps Jo home with her to save on daycare costs. I work 2 jobs for the time being so I can get my hours up for my certification so I can be eligible to work alone and not under someone. Because of this I am often tired. 

I never have days off and by time I get home I basically have enough energy to eat dinner and pass out. The whole situation started a while ago when Sadie mentioned she would like to try to go out once or twice a month. I explained i might not be able to commit to that but I’ll try my best. 

At first it was ok but bringing Jo along with us prolonged the evening often or wasn’t as relaxing as just a date so by the end of the night I was either irritated or more tired than before. 

We had a talk and Sadie agreed to put Jo in part time daycare so we could have more adult time together. But she only put her in 3 days a week and it’s usually during the times I’m working so when I get home I still don’t have a break or just adult time, but Sadie does. 

Recently one of her cousins moved close to us and Sadie paid him to watch Jo after hours so we could have a date. I had an amazing time and suggested Jo pulls her from daycare and just has her cousin watch her for date night once in a while. 

We got into an argument because she feels like I just don’t want to be around Jo and I feel like I should be able to request alone time with my lady away from a child that at the end of the day isn’t my responsibility. Sadie said I knew from day one what I was getting into when pursing her but I feel like I signed up to be with HER not be a replacement dad. I understand Jo will always be there, but Sadie can’t expect me to be happy to see an upset toddler after working 15-18 hours at 2 jobs nearly EVERYDAY and the few times we get to go on a date we have to spend most of dinner making sure Jo doesn’t have a tantrum or is entertained. 

I love Sadie I really do, but since Jo is hers she should be responsible for finding childcare and making sure we have alone time. I just don’t think I’d push my kid on a partner that didn’t have one. Sadie went to stay with her cousin and has been responding very vaguely whenever I reach out. AITA?",1690070610.0
AITA (23F) for “heartlessly” giving up my cats?,2,156wder,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156wder/aita_23f_for_heartlessly_giving_up_my_cats/,15,"Edit: “and couldn’t was struggling to find the last one” meant to say and he was struggling to find the last one a home. 

Edit 2: This was brought to attention by Reddit users. I didn’t ask my sister before as she does love the cats but she did say she can’t take them in because she has a husband, baby (14month old) and two cats of her own. 

Edit 3: I should clarify. I’ll be attending university in Oxford but I live in London, the army cadets I’m volunteering at is in Windsor, Berkshire, UK. As you can see travelling takes up a lot of my time but it’s something I love. 

I (23F) had a mum who had special needs, she passed away 2 years ago. After the death of our rescue cat in 2014 my mum asked me if we could get another cat. I agreed. 

Mum felt that our first cat (aged 8 now) was “lonely” and for four months she kept asking me to get a second cat (now aged 6). A friend of mine at school mentioned that his cat recently gave birth to a litter of kittens and couldn’t was struggling to find the last one. 

I mentioned my mum has been asking for a second cat for four months and decided to adopt it. My friends mother gave me a lift to their place to pick up the cat then drove me back home. 

Mum was wondering why I was late home. I brought the kitten in and she was so happy and over come with joy, there was no way I couldn’t get rid of the cats whilst she was alive. 

I’m not an animal lover but I’m also not an animal hater, I don’t mind them but prefer not to own them.  

For the past two years I kept the cats as I didn’t have a lot going on so I had the time to look after them. 

Three months ago things changed. I got accepted into university and will be attending university 3 days a week in Oxford, I’m also volunteering an army cadets which is 3 days a week (2 hours on a Tuesday evening and events on a weekend). 

As well as that I’ll be working for that one day spare each week as I need the money. As you can see I’m pretty busy. 

Because of my schedule I took some time to think about what would be the best thing about the cats. I asked myself could I feed them and give them enough love that they need and deserve and the answer to that was no. 

I stated that I have a sister. My sister and I don’t have a brilliant relationship. She prefers to see me once or twice a year max. I knew she wasn’t going to say goodbye to them. 

So I decided to phone my local RSPCA branch and explained the situation they took the cats and will rehome them together. 

My sister came round yesterday after four months and asked where they were. I explained that I gave them up for adoption as it was for the best. 

She told me that I was an ahole for giving them up and that I did it heartlessly. I do feel like I may have been the ahole for the way I handled the situation but I’m not sure.

My bestfriend recently went through a messy break-up where she cheated on her shitty-ex.

Around that time my parents had separated and we were all just trying to get our barings.

As life has it, dad moved on and met a woman who we'll call Mac for the sake of this story. Mac and I were super close before she moved in, she was really sweet and kind and seemed to genuinely have all of our best interests in mind. So when Dad told me that she was moving in, you can imagine that I was excited.

When she moved in, they both began drinking heavily together in the living room watching TV. It became hard for me to spend time with him because they did this nearly every night. I

f I would try, a fight would start because I interrupted them, or because Mac doesn't really like having the same conversations dad and I do with each other, as we can get pretty serious.

So I'd go into the living room to show him a meme, tell him about something I found, and then it wouldn't go too far without Mac blowing it up into some pointless argument.

Last night, I was trying to talk to them and Mac went on about how she didn't like how often dad thought about work, and how that just stressed him out and wasn't her idea of relaxing. 

I tried to explain to her that he actually enjoys his job and likes to do things with it, even at home, but I have noticed a history of her taking her own personal experiences and deciding that's the default for everyone.

She barely listens to me, and it's worse when she's drunk. Well, dad had a long day at work and ended up dosing on the couch, which made Mac scoff and she glared at me saying ""Great, now he's asleep and our night is ruined."" 

I got upset, because this isn't the first time she's said something like this. I said ""Okay, I'm sorry, enjoy your night."" and then I walked back to my room.

Soon after I heard Mac get up in a huff, pouting and storming away while dad sat up calling after her. This is how she usually acts when we get into fights.

I texted dad from my room, saying I didn't appreciate what she said to me, and that I felt she hated me for whatever reason. He was quick to bat for her, and began turning everything back on me. 

He felt that her comment toward me was justified because I keep interrupting their time together, and since we work together and had been on a job that day, we HAD spent time together and she deserved his attention too.

I don't disagree with that, but I do disagree that our working is us ""spending time"" together. I'd also like to note that these problems started LONG before we began working together.

Hanna’s kids ages are: 9, 7, 2, 2, 2. She is widowed, so they live with her full time. 

This made room arrangements a bit awkward, since there’s only 3 kids bedrooms to go around. Dad and Hanna talked it over last night (without consulting anybody) and Hanna came over this morning to announce with my dad what they decided. Apparently, they want 9 and 7 to each have their own rooms, and me to share with the triplets because my room is significantly bigger than the others “and I don’t stay there full time”. 

I said their plan was stupid, they wanted me to share with 3 toddlers. They said they didn’t want me to move but it was the biggest room so other people should share. I said I didn’t care if I switched rooms, because the more logical move would have been the triplets in the big room, 7 and 9 share, and I get my own (I said I’d take the smallest one) until I move out. They said it would be more work to move my things to another room, and their idea was more “practical”. Then asked why I was so pressed since I don’t even live here full time. 

I said not staying in the room four days a month was a sorry excuse to land me with a bunch of toddlers, and if they seriously planned on doing it to me I’d make the custody arrangement change and I’d stay with mom for the most part (I know she doesn’t mind because both of them remind me I could stay with her whenever I wanted).

This made Hanna cry because she just wants her family to blend together nicely and apparently I was ruining her plans. This made dad mad at me and Im not allowed to talk to Hanna until she forgives me. I didn’t know this meant so much to them but I’m still saying I’ll stay with mom longer if I have to share with toddlers,but my dad made me feel a bit guilty so AITA?

UPDATE: I’m at my moms house at least for the weekend while the adults ‘try to work things out’ but my mom said I was welcome to live with her full time and if I really wanted we could change the custody agreement. :) Also thank you for all the replies I really wasn’t expecting this to blow up as much as it did lol",1689907875.0
AITA for locking a common space bathroom?,6,156s5jy,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156s5jy/aita_for_locking_a_common_space_bathroom/,7,"I’ll give a bit of background, I (24M) signed a lease agreement for a full house, alone.

After which, I got permission to get 2 roommates  (25F and 34M) for the property outside of the tenant agreement, so through a standard roommate agreement ( the other two roommates are not on the lease agreement)

I made an agreement with one (25F)  that in addition to a shared bathroom with a shower upstairs that the two roommates are using, she can use the main floor half bathroom  (no shower in that one) as another toilet and sink if she likes, however it is technically meant to be a common bathroom, so we would respect her priority in using that bathroom, however it would also need to be available for any external guests to use, and I would handle cleaning of the main floor bathroom accordingly if guests use it.

I mentioned that guests would need to be able to access the bathroom, however she has a weird habit of changing doorknobs AND putting external locks on top of her doorknob as added security.

Recently, she took off the doorknob to the main space bathroom and left it as such with no knob, and when I saw this, I reinstalled the lock and locked it from the inside for a few days, thinking she could still continue to use the upstairs bathroom as well as another bathroom in the basement anyways. I messaged her stating not to change the doorknob on the main floor bathroom, however she is upset with me being inconsiderate for locking the main floor bathroom without consulting her first.

This is not the first issue i’ve had with her as she has repeatedly woken all of us up at 4am with loud alarms that she did not turn off for over 15 mins, and when I asked her to turn those off in a timely manner she got upset with this, claiming that I cannot get upset with her for this when I locked the downstairs bathroom.

I get a feeling this may be a YTA or an ESH for me, but I wanted to hear Reddit’s thoughts as it is in fact my house that I am renting out to her and she is not on the tenancy agreement I have with the landlord.

WIBTA if I bail on a family vacation?,3,156w5y7,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156w5y7/wibta_if_i_bail_on_a_family_vacation/,14,"My mom and aunt booked a beach vacation for my grandma and got a house big enough for my family to join. We committed once we knew we could afford the airfare. 

In the meantime, for the last 18 months my mom and dad are attempting to co-grandparent after being divorced for 15 years due to his alcoholism. 

They visited my husband (44M), our three kids (8F/7F/3F), and I (37F) last month during a very difficult time for my family. We were exhausted from closing a major business deal over the previous six months and then my husband’s best friend died. My folks arrived three days after we got home from husband giving his eulogy. 

Mom started out compassionate but upon finding that her home remodel (to be best us seasonally) wasn’t finished, went into a deep depression. She chose to stay in my dad’s Airbnb instead of our home. And him sneaking drinks drove her further into a downward spiral.

Together they spent the next three weeks beating up on my family- telling me constantly about how our home is too small and old, our kids are dirty and unkempt, baselessly accusing my husband of an affair, questioning whether we educate our children (like at all), whether they are college bound, whether my husband even makes a living.

This was so insanely detached from reality- we have a high value but admittedly old home in a popular downtown neighborhood, our kids (legally) half homeschool for foreign language and are at or above grade level in their “real” school, they do get dirty because our usual activities are hiking/camping/fishing/gardening/tide pools/etc. but they bathe regularly. We each freelance and teach with in our field and run a small business together that just made life-changing amounts of money.

I feel like my parents spent the month shoring up their bad relationship by shit-talking my husband. And my dad is crafting a narrative of my husband being a deadbeat, adulterous AH so he can convince my mom “maybe I’m an alcoholic but I always provided for you and never cheated on you unlike that loser.”

I’m furiously angry and deeply disturbed. I told my mom all this was unacceptable and she’s started therapy and says she’s trying to get away from dad again (but they’re currently visiting my sister together). 

Husband is bailing on the vacation, but isn’t asking me to because he knows I want to see grandma who is recently recovered from cancer. 

But I don’t want to spend time with people who (a) think my family sucks so much and (b) did nothing but kick us when we were already down with grief. 

Mom says I’m being an AH because she and my aunt spent extra money to accommodate us, withholding the grandkids is elder abuse, and we’ll break grandma’s heart if we don’t show up.",1690062082.0
AITA for not wanting another pet?,2,156z9ct,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156z9ct/aita_for_not_wanting_another_pet/,14,"Hi everyone. A bit of backstory first. Myself and my wife have always had pets. Dogs, cats, fish etc. for many many years.

We have two rabbits and a cat as pets at the moment. Just lately we've moved house and money is tight. The cat has been ill and despite being insured, has still cost a lot of money. It's likely he's in the last few months of his life.

I don't really want any pets for a while and we do still have the bunnies.

I'd like a break from the vets bills, the food bills, the damage they can cause and if I'm honest, dealing with faeces. We've had pets for nearly thirty years now and I just wanted to maybe just have the bunnies for a bit.

Maybe just for a while, to see what it feels like.

Anyhow, my wife is firmly in the camp that we must have an animal all the time, forever. Soon as she thought the current cat might have to be put to sleep, she was looking for a new one (despite us living next to a main road now). She earns a decent wage but she's always struggling to pay bills, especially when vets bills are a common outgoing and it's my opinion that maybe we could try to save up a bit and get the chaos of the house repairs out of th way as a priority.

However, without telling me, she's arranged to re-home a cat that apparently doesn't like going outside so the road won't be a problem (allegedly).

I realised that, as an adult, she can do whatever she wishes but if I'm honest, I'm a bit disheartened by it. I'd hoped we'd be able to make sightly more sensible decisions now, taking each others view points into account. And I'm upset she's organised it without even telling me.

She thinks I'm being mean though and that she can't live without a cat.

For the first time in my life, I’m in a very financially stable place. 

The original plan was to take my immediate family out to a nice dinner and a boat party to celebrate. My family is large: I have three brothers that I grew up with. My parents divorced when I was young (about 8), and my father had primary (practically sole) custody of all kids. Both my parents have remarried, and there’s fourteen people total in my blended family. 

When I called my mother to let her know about my plans a little while back, she let me know that she was having problems in her marriage (nothing specific, but she said things “were very bad”). I still gave the invite to the whole family because my mom has a huge tendency to complain.  To be completely honest, I didn’t take her seriously. 

Well, a couple days ago, I found out that she actually filed for divorce and had kicked my step-father out. I tried talking to her about it, but she didn’t want to talk or meet. I talked to my step-father and he clearly wasn’t doing great, but he said no matter what I would still be a daughter to him. He asked if he could still be a part of my birthday celebration and if his kids could come because they’ve purchased plane tickets to come to town and have gifts for me. Without hesitation, I said of course. 

I talked to my mom about it and she was absolutely livid. She said I had no idea what happened between them (but wouldn’t tell me when I asked) and demanded that my step-father and step-siblings be uninvited. I’ve been receiving messages from her calling me an AH for not confirming they won’t be there yet. 

When I talked to my bio dad about the whole thing, he told me to avoid the drama by uninviting my mom and having everyone else in my family come, including my step-father and -siblings on her side. 

Even though I’m not particularly close with my mom, I feel this horrible feeling in my gut. I really want to have an enjoyable birthday, but I’m worried that I’ll be making a really selfish decision by uninviting her.

TL; DR: I’m planning my birthday party with just my blended immediate family and I just found out my mom and step-father are getting a divorce. My mom is demanding I uninvite SF and his kids, but I think I may have a more enjoyable night if I  uninvite her.",1690061967.0

It's funny because they look like twins except my son has blond hair blue eyes and my nephew has brown hair brown eyes.

Both boys are now 11 and they had a falling our with each other last week. My son Thacher said that Dennis started to become an over ass to him lately. My son was over at their house yesterday and wanted to go home because Dennis was being mean like locking him out of the bedroom and saying mean things.

I blame my brother and his wife because they spoil Dennis aka ""Golden Child"" who thinks he can do no wrong and my son is just whiney and annoying. My son is very upset because his best friend is being so mean to him that he doesn't want to be around him but he still wants to be his friend. 

I can't fix this problem because the problem is with Dennis and how he's being raised. I told my brother and SIL and it set off a massive conflict between us. I told them that my kid can get along with everyone and they are raising a kid who is going to end up running over someone and fleeing. I see it and they don't.

Michelle wishes to only have the responsibility of putting the kitchen bin outside IF its full on a single Saturday, every three weeks. When asked what we would do if the kitchen bin was full on other days, or how the outside bin would be put out for collection, her response was (verbatim) ""That's your problem"". =/

So Michelle wants me and Sarah to have the responsibility of putting the kitchen bin outside, and the outside bins out for collection 20 out of 21 days, and she will cover the other single day.

AITA for voicing concerns about uncle’s immigration journey?,1,1573pn8,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1573pn8/aita_for_voicing_concerns_about_uncles/,2,"I (26F) just moved back into my parents’ home temporarily while I apply to doctoral programs this fall. My parents emigrated to the US ~30 years ago, and through their struggles, managed to create a decent middle class life for themselves while partially supporting me and my sibling as we worked to put ourselves through college debt free.

My uncle is in his late 50s and has been forced to retire his leadership role from an airlines he spent his entire life working for. Unfortunately, due to him and his wife’s poor financial planning (e.g., spending frivolously, them and their college-aged son all live in different countries) and none having well-paying jobs, my uncle decided to move to the US to try to work and live here so he can better support his son and make some savings. The plan is for him to get his driver’s license, get a full-time job with decent pay and benefits, and improve his english.

It concerns me seeing how relaxed, seemingly overconfident, and naive my uncle is about how difficult his entry into the US workforce and assimilation into American society will be as well as how he is too proud to apply for “just any job” nor is spending enough time per day working on his goals to make faster progress. For example, he failed his driver’s test twice and thinks the DMV examiner was unfairly scoring him (after seeing his driving myself, it’s clear he’s rusty and still learning the road laws here). Although he’s trying to practice driving with family members whenever he gets a chance, the instruction he needs can’t be provided by my family members without considerable time and effort. I told my parents that he should sign up for a driving lesson before his next test, which took some convincing for them to see my perspective. He almost obtained a post office job, but was rejected, and had no clue why they rejected him. I saw his resume and it is really poorly written, with typos, incorrect grammar, inconsistent formatting, and information that isn’t relevant (e.g., that he is married and has a child). He later also realized he didn’t attach all the materials they might have wanted to review, like his diploma. I suggested to him that he use his social benefits to get help from a job center for immigrants, and he didn’t seem to take the advice seriously. He is also being selective about who he is willing to network with and is reluctant to use the available network I have to get a job in the hospitality industry.

I am concerned realizing how long this process might take given his lackluster approach to it all. I may be taking a harsh stance on this, and want to know if I’m the asshole for voicing my concerns about various things I’m noticing to my parents or for trying to communicate to my uncle the reality of his situation.",1690082760.0
WIBTA if I took my dead dad’s truck away from my grandfather?,2,156yyua,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156yyua/wibta_if_i_took_my_dead_dads_truck_away_from_my/,10,"This one has a lot to it and I’m not sure how much I’ll be able to fit in here so please ask as many questions as needed in the comments.

I (20s M) just recently lost my father to a tragic, untimely death. Prior to his death we hadn’t spoken in a year as we had a serious fight where he said some pretty hateful things to me. We have had a really rocky relationship the last 10 years due to his constant drug abuse, narcissistic behavior, and his overall lack of care towards me. I went no contact with him after the fight we had and hadn’t seen him at all until his funeral.

On the other hand he was incredibly close with his dad, my grandfather. I also had a pretty strained relationship with my grandfather because he would insert himself into our issues and take his side over mine. My dad shoplifted and got caught with narcotics so I’m not talking to him? I should be more understanding. That sort of thing. Despite that I tried my damn hardest to be around for my grandfather and talk to him as often as my schedule allows. He’s never extended this energy my way.

Well, after my dad’s death everything was left to me. My grandfather and dad were living together when he died so instead of turning his things over to me and asking for certain things, he kept everything and asked me if I wanted anything. This didn’t bother me at the time, I told him he could keep everything. Including a new, paid off truck.

About a month after his death my car broke down irreparably and I found myself in a really tight spot as I tried to get a new vehicle. Normally I would’ve been able to buy a new one, but we had a vacation planned and I had already sunk money into it that I couldn’t get back. I called my grandfather and asked if there was any way he could help, even just a little. He told me if he could, he would. I took the no for what it was and figured it out.

A few days before my vacation his wife messaged me and asked me to sign the truck over to her. I immediately told her no and said I’d put it in my name. His wife and my dad hated each other, he’d roll in his grave knowing her name was on his truck. Not only that, but there was a time when her name was on a trailer my grandfather made payments on and when they got into an argument she kicked him out and sold the trailer. I called him and told him we could either put the truck in my name or I’d be selling it and he could have some of the money to buy a new vehicle.

He chose to put it in my name.

Well, I just got told by my brother that my grandfather tried to sell him the truck. AT MY DAD’S FUNERAL.

He’s actively been trying to sell that truck out from underneath me for months, even knowing I was struggling and without a car. Even after I let him drive what’s rightfully mine and was going to go half with him if it was to be sold.

For me to explain myself better you should get to know what I mean by public area in my hometown. There’s a Lake that can be purchased in one of three parts.

You can either purchase time on the lake to reserve it for recreational use.  You can purchase time on the pier usually used for fishing or for photo sessions.

And lastly, you can purchase the large 8 table seating area for parties.

The private event it seems that they were renting out the lake itself while I was sitting at the end of the pier doing some light reading, I must admit, I did have my headphones on to drowned out some background noise most likely from the private event when I was approached by one of the organizers, who explained to me that they had rented out the lake for a speed boat drag race contest.

I tried to explain to him that I wasn’t here for the contest that I had come here every weekend just to do like a reading, and even showed him the graphic novel app I was reading even explain to me that because they rented out the lake that mean that I couldn’t be on the pier because I’d be getting a free show. I tried to explain to him that 1 I don’t care to watch the show because it’s not something I’m interested in and that 2 heading out, approach me I would had no idea what was even going on

Oh, he said there was that whether I was reading or not, they had an event going on and me being here and not purchasing a ticket was not allowed now I had to admit because I’ve never purchased a time slot for the lake that I can didn’t know how the rules were set up so rather than get into an argument were, I would make a big fuss only to be told I was wrong in the very end and possibly be banned from the area I just decided to leave as I was leaving I could hear him talk to his friends complaining about me saying some people just don’t have no fucking manners and are just fucking clueless.

Now while I am here, I did call Tim a bit agree I don’t feel like it was right for them to insult you like that just because I was unaware of what was going on so I want to know am I the asshole for not immediately leaving or buying the ticket when I asked?!

Edit: I used the talk to text function outside to write this, so that why it seem rushed or unclear. Let me try to fix that:

1: Other then some tents on the picnic/beach area there were no indicators of a ""Private"" event (No signs the only markers were in the water where the race was being held.

2: When I said I argued I meant that instead of pay for a ticket or immediately leave, I asked if it were possible for me to sit somewhere else where I wouldn't be a bother I said argue because he looked pissed at my question.

3: When I said I don't know the renting rules I mean I had no way of knowing if he paid for: Lake Time, Pier Time, Picnic/Beach Time or all three. Most only buy one!!",1690035574.0

A called me hours later and started talking about T and how she was reaching out so much when she “knew where she was bc T had made her schedule” (A didn’t thank T for the help).

A eventually came back to our room at 10:30pm. T went to talk to her bc we hadn’t heard from her. A let her in, but then A started screaming and crying that she’s too stressed to talk. A pushed T into a wall to run past her and straight out of the building. 

The next morning A had a talk with T&S. A  met me in the library a couple hours later i asked how the talk went and she said “i’m not upset at them but i’m still upset”. i asked her if she had a problem with me, and she said yes. 

she complained about me telling T, S, H, & R about what she was saying. this made no sense bc she had me tell her what they were saying. she then said to me “by the way, my dad is here i’m leaving. can you help me pack my car?” i was livid.

on my birthday, A texted me that she loved/missed me like nothing was wrong. i told her “thank you, but i really do think we should have a talk in the next few days to just get past this”. at this point i wasn’t too mad but i wanted to talk bc i wasn’t okay with her ignoring me. i called her a couple times trying to get in contact with her, no response.

the whole group planned a trip to S’s house. S reached out to A bc we didn’t hear from her, and we needed to know if she was going. A told S that she would be here. a couple days before the vacation, S asked A  when she would be arriving at her house. no response.

I had one before we started dating, and had to convince her to get one too so she could keep up. Lately, her board has been acting up quite a bit, which makes no sense to me bc we recently had it repaired. I often wonder if she even likes riding with me, because she gets irritated whenever we go on longer/tougher rides. Personally, it's a little frustrating that she bought it in the first place if she didn't like it. I've also asked her a few times if she's been purposely breaking it to get out of riding with me and she always says she's not.

Well today we were on a ride in the redwoods, and it broke down again. The board completely turned off and launched her off at from what I can gather was full speed (I didn't see it happen,) which really sucks because it's the very beginning of our camping trip so now I have to ride by myself. Anyways she said she thinks she broke her toe or something but I honestly didn't think it was that bad. She wanted me to carry her board back to camp since mine still worked, and I tried. But it was pretty sketchy since it was all uphill and they're so heavy so I had to give it back to her. From what it looked like, she handled it just fine (no limp, didn't look pained or anything.) But when we got back to camp, the toe did start looking a bit messed up, so I felt really bad and apologized. (Still don't think it's quite broken though.)

I decided I would ride into town to get her something that might make her feel better (there were a few thrift stores and gift shops near by) but pretty much everywhere was closed. Instead, I ended up going to a tourist attraction we were excited about riding together, which was pretty much a tree that you could drive through.

My dad booked tickets to visit Afghanistan in a couple of days and he is going to stay there for a month. I was a bit surprised by this news but he told me he hadn't seen his mom in person for more than 6 years and he wants to see her before she dies. I told him that right now it's very dangerous, the Taliban has risen to power and constantly you see beatings everywhere and kidnappings (my dad is very western in his way of thinking so that's why I'm scared something will happen to him).

But it's not stopping him from going because he says he'll regret it if he doesn't go and his mother dies. I can't stop him but  I'm scared if something is going to happen to him. I don't trust it there at all. It's dangerous, that's why everyone is fleeing and that's why they fled as well.

After a few minutes of confusion, it dawned on me that my father, who would not be able to attend himself as he lived outside the country, had signed my sibling(22) and I (20)up for a thanksgiving dinner with our uncle and his wife without running it by us beforehand. 

While I have went to his thanksgiving dinners in the past, and I had no plans for this thanksgiving, I was not fully against going as our uncle lives in our state. However my older sibling did not appreciate the fact that our father had promised our uncle that we would attend without asking us first. Couple that with the fact that he had already established plans to hang out with his girlfriend that day, there was no convincing him of going. I did not want to go alone, and we both decided to text our uncle that we really appreciated the invite however we unfortunately would not be able to attend this year as we had a “Friendsgiving”. 

a few days later, I called my father like normal and I could automatically tell by the tone In his voice that he was annoyed. After he hung up on me In the middle of our conversation. I immediately texted my younger sibling, who lived with him at the time, and asked, “he’s upset with me isn’t he?” My sibling then told me that my father said that he would not talk to us. 

For the next year my father would not speak with me nor my older sibling. No calls. No texts. Nothing. I tried to reach out to him on his birthday to wish him a happy birthday. However he ignored my call and left my text message on seen. 

During this period of no contact, my parents were going through a divorce which only added to the turbulence. 

I tried to reach out to him one more time, even though everyone around me urged me not to. My younger sibling told me that my father said that he “loved me” and to “have a good life”. After that I was completely checked out and had given up trying to rekindle a relationship with him.

6 months later my father called me and said that he wanted to establish a relationship again. While I am cordial with him, I do not text and call him nearly as much as I had use to. And truthfully, I do not know if I want to try and rekindle the relationship. My biggest concern is that what if I do something slightly inconvenient to him and he ostracizes me again?

Context: all 3 of us are going into our senior year of hs, one of the 2 is my SO of 4 years, they have both been very close best friends since I first met them in middle school, we all work part time and have the same schedule,  they both have strict parents while I don’t, I have caught them lying about being busy to hang out without me, we all have an app that allows us to see the others locations, and I have (diagnosed) generalized anxiety and depression.

My family and my therapist have told me that I should confront my 2 friends about possibly avoiding me and/or somehow make new friends, but I don’t have any other friends to talk about this with which is why I am resorting to Reddit for another opinion

So we have all been on summer break for a month now, and I have seen my SO once, and the 2 of them together once. This is somewhat typical because summer is always difficult, but I’ve noticed that they both hang out together almost everyday, and seem to be more difficult than ever to make plans with. When I text them to ask to hang out, it can sometimes take them between 2-6 hours to respond. When we do hang out, sometimes they want to do something only they like and it can feel like they are pretending I’m not there (completely in my anxious brain so huge grain of salt). Lastly, when I have in the past expressed that sometimes I feel left out, my SO will say that they thought I didn’t want to see them, and that it’s my anxiety (which could totally be true)

Would I be an asshole to think that they could be excluding me on purpose? I don’t know what to do I feel so lonely but I don’t want to make them feel bad if it’s just me being jealous",1690040999.0
WIBTA If I (M28) told my mom (F49) her gift box is not enough?,4,156ra5x,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156ra5x/wibta_if_i_m28_told_my_mom_f49_her_gift_box_is/,23,"So, I have been low contact with my mom for awhile now. Most of the reasons have been harsh criticism, a negative response to me coming out, and general issues with communication. I was clear with her as to what the reasons were and told her she is free to write me, but I would not be doing texts, phone calls, or visits without addressing my concerns. We've sent each other obligatory gifts for holidays but have not really communicated otherwise. I get thank you notes but don't typically respond to these because they don't address anything I've said and give me the feeling of her thinking that me giving her something means things are fine (when they are not).   


Apparently she went on vacation to Maui and got a bunch of souvenirs and she packaged them in a box with a note along with some books I had lent her previously. Most of the letter was focusing on what she bought and why. There was a small bit where she mentioned reading books I had given to her over a year ago relevant to some of the issues above. She had never acknowledged these before and never read them despite saying she would, which is at least a small indicator of change. The only small nitpick with this is she sent them saying she learned a lot, but didn't not specify what. There was nothing personal about the letter either. No sharing about her trip or asking about me.  


I still think that alone does warrant a response, however, it was clear from wording she was trying to show she cared through gifts and most of it was explanation about how buying things showed she cared, which feels transactional to me. I don't really care about material things (which I've said to her explicitly before), though I know this is how she typically likes to give and receive affection.  


 My question here is if saying in response that the gifts are appreciated but do not impact anything else, nor does my response indicate a change of heart and is not really enough at this point in time and just hammering in what is needed specifically. I can tell by the wording of the letter that the intent was to show care by buying things but I don't think that it does. I feel like being negative in response to getting a gift may be rude, and some people I know who I've talked to do agree. This is not something I'd typically do outside of a specific context like this. WIBTA?  


Note: this post isn't about if cutting her off is the AH thing to do or anything like that. I'm specifically talking about a response to this specific gesture. ",1690050042.0

Me(18M) and gf(18F) have been thinking about getting more serious in terms of marrying (Mind you this is years from now and we're 5 months into dating). She was born in the U.S., but her mother was undocumented when she came to the local hospital. When she was born she was automatically a U.S. citizen and Mexican citizen, meaning dual citizenship. We met in high school and started dating during the middle of our senior year. In the past, I've had several partners who, in the end, were either too promiscuous, cheated on me, too toxic, or it just never worked out. I've been told that relationships in high school are never the same as those in the ""real world"". I agree with this for the most part, however, with my current girlfriend, I see someone who I can share my life with. She is what most modern people lack in terms of being respectful, kind, smart, and overall a good person. And that is a very rare thing to find at my age. People my age like to hoe around and hop from person to person.

We both know what we want to study and focus on. We both support each other in our endeavors. For instance, she is going away to college to major in psychology with a specialization in clinical and I am attending community college to become a firefighter paramedic. With us being far apart we both know the outcome of long-distance relationships. It will be grueling, but we will make it work.

A few days ago, I talked about my girlfriend with my parents. They asked if we both were going to take a break or ultimately break up and focus on our passions and/or regroup and date again after being done with schooling. I said, ""No, we're going to ride it through and be together"". They unfortunately were not happy with that as they want me to have options and not have anyone hold me back. Especially my father. He was a bit upset with that because out of my 2 siblings, ""I'm most likely to marry and have kids sooner"". He was suggesting to have other girls on the side for when things go south. He in front of my mother suggested that I cheat on her to ""have more options"". By this point, I was pissed off. I know my morals and would not dare to cheat, because I've been cheated on in the past and know the feeling of it. My mother on the side was only listening and not adding any response whatsoever. Then, my father made a comment saying, ""She's only with you to get a green card"". But the comment that my father said made me frustrated. I cursed at both of my parents stating that they “fucking don't know anything about her” as she's a dual citizen, and they don't put as much effort to know her. Including saying how they are, ""fucking awful people should both shut the fuck up"". With that, my parents and I began shouting at each other. It ended when I found no use in fighting with them if they didn't care at all and went back into my room.

I feel bad about shouting at them. We haven't talked in days, and I feel a little guilty overall. AITA?

But the drama started 2 weeks ago when we got an Instagram dm from a small independent music label, they said they'd promote and distribute our music everywhere, and we just had to sign a Google doc, so we did it, and they paid for 5 days of studio time to record 10 or more songs for an album, all of which we'd already written and practiced, so we thought we were good to go, and our dreams were coming true.


Until one day the topic of changing the band name came up, as there's already a hard rock band called ""Mammoth WVH (Wolfgang Van Halen)"" and we didn't want to have any confusion. we all had different ideas, but for some reason the name ""Master's Touch"" came up and everyone loved it and wanted us to be called that for some reason, but I didn't like the name, I thought it was stupid.


so I told them and it basically turned into a huge argument about how I'm so controlling and how I never listen to their ideas, even though I do, and everyone was yelling at me and saying how I'm such a shitty person (which kinda came out of nowhere), until L said that it's too much and that he's leaving and been wanting to leave for a while, and V, C, and P all agreed to kick me out of the band, blaming me for L's departure, and they said they don't wanna use the songs I wrote, and they'll write their own songs. And he wiped all of our social media pages.


Then our manager, X (18m), called me and said he's taking L's spot in the band as drummer, and V is gonna do vocals, and told me I was in the wrong, and should have just agreed to call ourselves ""Master's Touch"". Then L left me an enraged voicemail saying I'm a piece of shit and he never wants to see me again. All because I didn't wanna rename our band to ""Master's Touch."" So AITA?",1690081271.0

My dad and my step mom all booked a cruise that's leaving tommorow. We did the road trip all the way to NY by splitting up and having 4 person in each car and we decided to stop in NYC to visit a bit but the experience was awful to me personally.

First my step mom was in a bad mood and was spreading her negativity all around the car barely an hour after we left the house while it was 3 in the morning and that annoyed a lot me and my dad who had to stay focused on the road so we told her to stop but that just fueled her even more. Everyone was in a bad mood and I tried my best to stay positive.When we arrived in NYC everyone was dead from lack of sleep but the other group of 4 really wanted to go to Times Square so I said we should go too and it could be fun. 

We meetup with the 4 other family members and we all say that we will go but they needed to get ready. 20 minutes later they ended up cancelling which slightly annoyed me cuz it was their idea and cancelling last minute like that was not fun but I thought everything was fine and tried to cheer everyone up. We went without the other group, my dad my stepmom and my sister. Everything was fine but the other group changed their mind AGAIN and decided to come anyways. 

They joined us for like 5 minutes then without a word disappeared. At this point my parents were getting annoyed and this happened several times throughout the entire time we were in Times Square : one of the group leaving the others behind and losing them and everyone was complaining non stop and badshing each other.

There was 0 organization to begin with and we had no real means of communication since we are foreigners (Canada) and we had no cellphone service. Everything was a mess and it was constant running around and trying to find each other with half the group wanting to sleep and the other wanting to go everywhere without waiting for the others, lots of negativity in the group and fights between my dad and my step mom. 

To finish the evening in beauty we went to a restaurant and waited 1 hour for cold food that we had to get refunded because of how bad it was and at this point everyone was sick of it and complained.

Throughout the whole thing I tried my best to try and avoid negativity and my parents kept fighting and arguing while everyone was just really tired but the amount of negativity spread by everyone complaining and all the anxiety I snapped too and started complaining as well when the food came.

On the way back to the hotel everyone was silent and didn't say anything and once we arrived there I explained to my dad that I had no fun at all and felt like shit cuz half the group didn't have fun either and the whole thing was just a massive negative chaos from everyone and I really hope that everything would go better on the cruise. My dad said that I was overreacting and he had fun and that he paid for the vacation so I should be grateful to even be there and I'm the one who suggested we should go with the other group (I was literally trying to find a way to do something fun). I explained that I'm not the only one who felt that way and he disagreed. My step brother literally had bloodshot eyes and was about to fall asleep in the middle of the sidewalk so I thought that was enough of a sign, not to mention him and my stepmom. CONSTANTLY fighting.

AITA for that? After cooling off a bit I feel like my dad might be right since I didn't pay for the vacation. Would it have been better if I didn't say anything about how I felt?

Since students at my school are not allowed to decorate their own graduation caps, I bought one and supplies from Amazon to decorate for my pictures. 

I’d asked my step mom to help me because she has more of a creative mind than I do, and we’d made a plan for me to go over to her house, because I live with my grandma. However, I got a text today that she “forgot” about an NRA dinner she had agreed to go to, because her mom is on the board.

I don’t think she forgot, because she and my father have a large calendar on their kitchen counter that they always fill out when they make an appointment or commitment. Not only that, if she’s out of the house when a commitment is made, she puts it in her cellphone calendar. There’s no reason for her to have forgotten. 

I believe that when I asked her, she said yes so as to not hurt my feelings, and later told me she forgot because she didn’t want to do it. This also isn’t the first time she’s been unavailable when we make plans together. Every, and I truly mean every, time we’ve made plans together, she texts me that she’s unavailable a few days before. She offered to reschedule, but in the past rescheduling has proven to be a waste because she never follows through. 

So, after hearing that she’s unavailable, when my supplies arrived I began decorating the cap. When she and my dad found out, they got incredibly upset with me and said I should have waited, but I needed the cap to be finished by a certain day so the glue would be fully cured, and there would be no risk of things falling off during pictures. I told them this, and they insisted it would have even though the next day she’d be available was the day of my pictures. I didn’t want to risk it because she has a habit of being very unreliable.

Back in high school me and a couple of mutual friends started to hang out together and it turned into a friend group which I was very fond of. About 3 years had passed and a new guy (Kevin M19) came into our group. Initially I was fine with him we even hang out a couple of times, but I won't say that I actually liked him.

I just always though he did not fit in since he was a bit awkward around the girls and seemed to have no filter with his remarks on the topics that we discussed (ex.sports and movies). After a couple of months of this and multiple attempts to get him to stop (from all the guys in our friend group) he still had no filter and by this point we where all a beginning to get uncomfortable around him. Most everyone in the group are down to earth sweethearts and I'm guessing that's the reason he stuck around for so long. I became pretty distant with him and started to not invite him to our parties.

After a few times of not inviting him he started to spread rumors about me but it didn't work since my friends knew me too well at that point to believe him. A couple of days after I found out about the rumors there was another party to which he was also invited. At the party (after a couple of bevies) I pulled him into a room and went off on him. I explained how after months of trying to relay to him that his unpleasant remarks was creating an atmosphere and his weird conversations that he forced when we where around the girls made me not invite him to any more parties. I also told him that it was childish to spread rumors about someone, and that if he wanted to be a child he should hang out with his mom.

After the party everyone got quiet and I heard from no-one for a few days. I tried to check in and only one friend replied telling me that Kevin had told everyone what i said and that I'm an unfiltered bitch since he doesn't have a mom. This was the first time I had heard he did not have a mom and I am feeling really bad about what I had said. I tried to apologize and to explain that I didn't say that with the intention of attacking a vulnerability and that I had insufficient information.

Days have went by with the group divided with only two of my closets friends hanging around with me and the rest hanging out with Kevin while my voice has not been heard.

This has been a huge shock as I have a condition that causes infertility as well as a cyst on one of my ovaries and have been told my chances of getting pregnant are very slim but not non-existent. We are usually very careful as I’m currently not on any birth control and have a severe allergy to latex and lubes however we slipped up and I was ovulating when we did it one time. 

We’ve both agreed that we are not in a stable position to raise a child and as abortion is legal in my country I will be getting one and he has agreed to support me throughout it all. Now given that i’m five weeks along a huge wave of symptoms have smacked me down very suddenly and this was my main reason for getting a pregnancy test (I did four to be certain on the results). 

Today I was supposed to be doing a 12 hour shift, I work as a bartender in a restaurant and he also works with me as a manager (not specifically MY manager but a manager) and we do genuinely get along very well at work and keep our at home issues out of it. However it got to around 19:00 and I was having strong cramps, nausea, fatigue and on the verge of tears so he told me to go back to ours (we live in a shared staff house together) and get some rest. I felt guilty as this now meant that he had to cover the bar as the other bartender was covering our other bar upstairs and we were already very short staffed.

I fell asleep almost instantly after getting home and text him a couple hours later to see how he was getting on and he told me it was going okay but he was planning on going out to one of his friend’s house for some drinks after work and asked if I was okay with that. My honest answer was that I wasn’t and that i’m really not doing okay and would rather him come back here as I needed him most right now. I felt guilty saying this and I know he covered for me and let me go home early, normally i wouldn’t have an issue with him going out but with our situation at the moment I’m at a lower place and just want him. 

He seemed to not be too happy with my answer and suddenly went very blunt in his messages, I told him i couldn’t control what he does but wanted to just be honest about how I felt and he said claimed it was okay but I could tell that it wasn’t. He came back about 20 minutes ago and hasn’t spoken much to me.

Last Sunday, at brunch I threw out the idea about Rolling Loud Music Festival that we watch every year for the last 3-4 years was happening on July 22nd. I told her I wish we could go but her sister is in town. AND I asked her if I could still go since i wont have any plans... she said sure.... I brought it up a couple days in a row before actually buying tickets, she didn't complain. Until AFTER I brought my tickets then she goes nagging about how we watch it every year on TV and felt I am being petty and selfish by going without her. She mentioned especially because I'm having fun... but her sister and son just wants to chill in the hotel.

We've had a few verbal spats back and forth.

 My side of this is i have nothing to do this weekend,  i am on a fat loss regime and trying to be active to accelerate my process. I weight lift 5x a week  so i am using the festival as an oppty to burn some extra calories from cardio see a few artists i like then go home.

From what I understand, he’s not cruel, but they have conflicting personalities and so she doesn’t have much of a relationship with him, and feels he didn’t support her with her mental health stuff and takes that as a betrayal.

I definitely know where she’s coming from, and accordingly, I don’t think he’s a great dad either. 

Anyhow, she mentioned to me today that her dad doesn’t speak French or English very well whereas the rest of the family does fluently and mostly communicates in it (they’re Lebanese). So he has a hard time following and when he does speak he uses like broken phrases.

I said it must be hard for him that he can’t even follow conversations from his own family most of the time and that it must be lonely. Because imagine your family has conversations all the time and you can barely understand them. Plus, it must also be hard that whenever he tries to communicate he knows he sounds weird due to broken French/English.

She got angry at me for ‘siding with’ her dad, but I don’t see it as doing that. I think it can both be true that I agree in many ways he’s a bad dad, and still feel sympathy about how he must feel lonely in his own home.

I (30/f) recently got engaged to my partner (30/m). We are yet to live together, but in the meantime, we stay over at each other’s places regularly. I stay over more at his place just because he has a bigger space/flat. 

Here’s the thing though, I’m a bit of a clean freak and he can be quite messy. Now that we’re engaged I’m realising that the expectation to move in with him is now a real thing. When we were just dating, I just ignored the state of his flat to avoid conflict, but now I dread living in a messy place and I’m starting to dislike hanging out at his.

I want to be really honest with him and just say a clean space brings me peace and a messy place stresses me out. I want to encourage him to clean, but maybe I’ll come across as demanding, its his place after all! I cant keep hanging out in a cluttered place though. I think my bf will get defensive and maybe he just doesn’t see the mess.",1690032232.0

A little pre-context, over a year ago my mother told me that I ruined her life after I rescued a dog, told me that I should not have kids and should just have dogs for the rest of my life, and if I were to have kids that she wanted nothing to do with them and did not want to be a grandparent. This was difficult to hear as I struggle with severe endometriosis and have been trying with my husband for a few years, which she was aware about.

My husband and I were shocked and devastated by this. Her behavior and treatment towards us seemed completely out of the blue and was without any instigation. She even blocked our numbers and our social media accounts. We had no clue what we did wrong and still have no clue today. 

  
Now, over a year later, she messages me saying that she's on her way and will be at my house in an hour, but never shows up. My husband and I waited for over two hours for her to ""come over"" to find out it was all a manipulative scheme to force me to talk to her. I ended up feeling hurt by her all over again.

Originally Matt and I were very close friends, but Amy and I grew to be very close and she became my best friend. 

For the last 3-4 years Amy and Matt’s relationship has been pretty toxic, a lot of drug use involved, passive aggression, and fighting. About a 1.5 years ago, they broke up, but were still in close contact due to our living/work situation. About 4 months after that breakup, Matt begins to date Erin (f27.) This relationship proves to be even more toxic, with even more drug use and public fights. By this time Matt and I had begun to drift apart as friends, but I was still very close with Amy and was there for her through all of this. It was hard and there was a lot of hurt going on there. 

During that time, Amy and our other friend, Mary (f28) had a big falling out due to the way Amy was treating Erin. At the time, I was on Amy’s side, because I though Mary was only looking at it from Erin and Matt’s perspective. When Erin and Matt broke up, Amy continue to be very shitty to Erin and kept trying to get people against her. I did not participate in that due to not wanting to be a part of the drama. 

Near the end of last summer, I got clean and moved away. I started to go to Uni and have been working on my mental health. Amy also moved away and was doing better, until a family emergency forced her to move back. I again was in contact with her for moral support and to just be her cheerleader. 

Yesterday Amy called me and told me that she had gotten back with Matt, had seen Erin and was shitty to her again. To be frank, I was pretty mad and disappointed in her about it and told her such. When we spoke again today, I told Amy that I didn’t think it was right of her to get back with Matt, that it wasn’t fair to either of them to continue with their toxic relationship and that she had lost friends over it. Likewise, they had both put Erin through hell and it wasn’t fair to everyone around them that had done the emotional labor of being there for Matt and Amy after each break up. I finally told her that I wasn’t going to be there for her this time around and she told me that the friendship is over them. 

I feel like an asshole for meddling in their relationship and abandoning by best friend when it inevitably blows up again. At the same time, I don’t want to be around the toxic shit again. So, AITA?",1690047289.0

Now the party is tomorrow so I texted everyone to confirm that they're coming. And she texts me saying she isn't coming. When I ask why she says because she isn't comfortable around the people I invited because they aren't friends and she doesn't want to have to ""mentally prepare herself to come"" or ""feel on edge the whole day"".

I have a now ex-friend who recently blocked me on everything. This is happened a couple times before so I didn't really think anything strange of it since this friend has a lot of mental issues and tends to sporadically isolate themselves.

A couple of days pass and I noticed that I'm really the only one blocked, I asked my partner to check up on them and a day passes and I get a response. Talking about how I purposely ignored them all the time and that I excluded them from everything, they're sick of me 'playing with their emotions' and that if I really cared about them I would still keep in contact. 

We talked about this before since this was definitely an issue they felt and I assured them that I still wanted to be friends because at the time they felt like I didn't want to be their friend anymore but it was really because I was busy. 
The way they worded their response made it seem like they did not regard what i had going on in my life at all

 these past months have been extremely hard for me, and extremely busy where I really only have time to hang out with my friend group as a whole,and even then I made sure that this ex friend wasnt excluded because I knew a lot of people would talk over them a lot.

I tried to send things when I can but it really wasn't much and I do acknowledge that. If I could have done more I would have but I really didn't have the time or energy since at that point in my life my depression had reached an all time low

They wanted ME to reach out but they didn't at all, and usually when we did talk it would eventually lead to them just venting about their life and I will admit it did get a little tiring.

I've asked friends and family about the situation and they do think I'm in the right here but I still feel really guilty about it and I do they find friends that will be able to contact them constantly. (Edited for typos)",1690064774.0

My biological mother (54f) neglected and abused me my whole childhood and I spent my teens being raised by other people.

I got into a prestigious college on an academic scholarship and have been taking care of myself since 18. 

My mom and I rekindled our relationship when I was 16 (at this time, I was still in foster care, but we were in communication). Our relationship has been great since I turned 18. 

About 8 months ago, I had a complete mental breakdown. I was admitted to a psychiatric facility and took a semester off school (I suffer from depression, anxiety, and bipolar). Because I wasn’t enrolled in school, I didn’t receive my usual financial aid and was unable to pay rent. 

My mom is very wealthy and she SPLURGES. I asked her if she’d be willing to help with my rent for a few months and she agreed. We never talked explicitly about how and when I’d pay it back, but it was a loan. 

Fast forward to now, I’m supposed to start school in less than a month and she is expecting me to give her my entire financial aid package in full to pay her back. The issue with this, is it’ll put me in the exact situation that we’re in: I won’t have financial aid to pay for rent. 

The simple answer is get a job. That answer isn’t so simple as I’m now behind in school and have to take over a full course load to finish on time. And to afford my current bills, I’d have to work full time. This would mean taking 5 classes at school and working 40 hours a week. As someone that struggles with the mental health problems I have, this isn’t going to work. If I can’t use my financial aid next semester, I’m pretty sure I’ll have to drop out. 

I’m tired of asking my mom for money and I know I’m capable of the independence I had before, I just wish she would let me pay her back another time. I feel defeated and ashamed. Any money I do earn goes towards other bills, food, and needs. Some days I don’t eat because I don’t want to ask for anything, even though I know she has the money. 

I just WISH that my mom supported me the way I see my friends’ parents support them. I wish she would let me pay her back later rather than install a freaking home theater in her house and renovate her entire backyard. I wish she prioritized me for once in my life.

I first met him through my online friends back in quarantine and we became close friends over time. Our main group fell apart due to drama, although I never had any problems with him so faintly kept in touch with him through social media.

Fast forward a few months and this friend, we'll call him Jake (17M), got into a really bad situation. His ex gf came out with some very hefty statements, so I asked him what it was all about. When I talked to him about it, he was very stressed, lost, confused and apologetic. He was frantically trying to figure out what he could do to fix the situation and was eager to apologize to his ex gf and make it right. At the time, I didn't drop him because I believed this was a communication issue on both ends and saw that he was really trying to do whatever he could to make things right.

Jake lost all his friends and started to fall off academically because of his mental health. I felt that he was mistreated in this situation, so took him under my wing. I made sure to check up on him daily and always be online to play games whenever he needed a distraction. However, I was slowly burning out, which led me to introduce him to my main friend group. They are all mostly boys a year or two older than him and they got along really well. We all played videogames together and everyone loved him since he was always so sweet to them. He thanked me mulitple times for taking care of him and always told me about how happy he was to have met everyone.

Recently, I reconnected with one of my old online friends from our original group, we'll call her Layla. (Note: Layla was the first person I got close to in that group.) I talked to her and asked why she doesn't talk to Jake anymore and she told me 6 different rumors about him from other people, all being related to the first rumor of this story. I talked to Jake about it and he admitted to 2 of them, 1 of them being proven true through evidence. Making 3 out of 6 rumors true. At first, I didn't want to accept it or acknowledge it because I just couldn't believe it.

AITA for confronting a friend for sending me an edible arrangement?

He’s confessed his feelings for me and I do have a boyfriend so I turned him down and let him know I wasn’t interested, with the preface of still being friends.
Fast forward a couple months he had gotten more and more pushy about hanging out 1 on 1 and that made me and my boyfriend a bit uncomfortable but nothing happened between us. 

The specific event that triggered everything was my visit to the ER for an infected cyst. It was quite a minor procedure. Although it hurt in the moment afterwards I was pretty much fine, just dosed with hydrocodone and sent home to heal. I let my friend group know and before I knew it Derek was messaging me trying to get me to hang out with him under the influence of narcotics. Derek was being very assertive about it even when I said I didn’t feel comfortable, he even said he’d pick me up since I couldn’t drive. I told Derek I wasn’t comfortable with that a few times and he let it go. 
I told my boyfriend about this because it was giving me weird vibes but nothing really worth having a conversation about until the fateful day of the edible arrangement. 

So I get a knock on the door and it’s a “get well soon” edible arrangement addressed from Derek. My biggest red flag is I’ve only sent my address in the friend group chat once (we never hang out at my house I live with my parents still) so he either saved it or scrolled through months of messages to find it. Both I find very strange, but that could be a totally normal thing people do. 
Not going to lie I was a bit creeped out even though it was a kind gesture on surface level, so I immediately called my boyfriend and told him. 
In my boyfriend’s words,”I don’t send get well edible arrangements to my friends but I would to a girl I liked or my girlfriend.” 
To that I did partially agree especially because it was such a minor procedure that not even my closest friends and family sent get well soon stuff they just texted me (which I found adequate). 
My boyfriend and I came to an agreement no more hanging out with Derek 1 on 1 and to let him know he overstepped. I happily agreed with him. 

Today I let Derek know and the conversation with him went well although he doesn’t want to hang out anymore, even around other people because he’d be “walking on eggshells” around my boyfriend. 
I kind of think this is an excuse because he’s embarrassed for getting caught red-handed so to speak, but I may be wrong. He’s texted me saying he feels bad about “causing issues” between me and my boyfriend and I just really don’t know if I’ve been misunderstanding his actions or not. 

Anyway I’ll leave it up to Reddit was Derek’s gift an innocent get well gift or were there other intentions behind it. AITA?",1690077157.0

It’s so bad that their food will have animal hair in it. These people will pick the animal hair out of their mouths and keep on chewing like it’s the most normal thing in the world.

I can't remember a time since we got the dog that he's taken care of her all day by himself. If I go away for a few days, I always make sure someone comes to take her out once or twice during the day while he's at work. He has decided, and has said to me, that he just expects be to be around to take care of her. I've had a few minor surgical procedures on my back and have had to take care of her the next day because he just takes off. I've brought up his lack of involvement on several occasions, and he'll help out with her more for a week or two and then go right back to disregarding her.

He's moving out at the end of the lease in a few months and is resentful of the fact that I'll be keeping the dog. I've told him that he'd be able to visit her after he leaves, and he'd be the first person I call to take care of her if I go on vacation and can't take her with me. But I've been thinking about it, and I wonder why should I? He's shown me time and time again that she is not a priority to him, and I have to wonder if he would actually take care of her if I leave her with him. He would never physically hurt her, but I don't know if she'd be taken out and fed or brought to the vet if something happens. And that concerns me. I would do anything to make sure my dog is safe and well taken care of. So WIBTA if I don't ask him to watch her after he leaves?",1690055196.0
AITA for coming home at 1am and then not listening to my dad when he told me no?,1,1571mxf,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1571mxf/aita_for_coming_home_at_1am_and_then_not/,14,"hi, I (21F) went out to bars last night and in the midst of it my contact had somehow popped out of my eye. My friend and I made a plan to go back to my house so I could pick some up. I was texting my brother so that he could open the door for me but he was telling me no and to turn around, I was in an uber, because I would wake up my dad and get us both in trouble. When I got there, I went through the door in my brother’s room bc I know it’s unlocked, I didn’t wake him up he was still playing video games. At this point, he’s yelling at me but I wasn’t taking him too seriously so when I got my things I left. My friend and I waited for the uber to pick us back up and my brother came out to yell at us some more. Right before the uber arrived, my dad came out and was pissed. He told me to say goodbye to my friend and come inside. This is where I fucked up. Instead of saying goodbye, I got in the uber with her and went back. I was angry because earlier that day I had cleaned the whole house and ran errands for my dad so that I would be able to go out that night. This prompted my dad to follow me and pick me up. I have never seen him more angry in my life. I have been feeling really really awful about this but it’s hard reconciling with my feelings about it because while I understand I shouldn’t have overtly disrespected my father by not listening to him, I felt that his request of me leaving my friend in an uber was a bit much.

AITA for being upset my friend didn’t tell me they had a thing for me?,6,156qwqs,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156qwqs/aita_for_being_upset_my_friend_didnt_tell_me_they/,7,"I [21F] have been best friends with M [21NB] since we were 10 years old. We’ve known each other since we were toddlers and share everything with one another.

I first noticed them being off when I started dating at around 15 - they’d message any guy I started talking to ‘warning’ then that if he hurt me, they’d make him pay for it. Needless to say, it scared any guys off. I asked them not to and they kind of went silent over it and it wasn’t mentioned again.

Then they started dating someone, L [F], last summer. My friends and I met her a few times and we started joking how she looked a bit like me and we had similar personalities etc. I didn’t think anything of it and laughed it off. I got along with the girlfriend and we even hung out without M a few times. They didn’t last super long, maybe about six months, and one of the reasons L decided to break it off with him was because she felt that M chose me over her. I thought it was absurd because from what I had been told, M was bending over backward for her at times. 

Now, I have a few close friends that I trust with anything: M, B & C. With this, we are very open with each other and (some may find this weird, but I promise it’s normal for us!) we send each other our nudes slightly covered to ‘check’ if it’s hot enough to send to whoever we’re talking to. We’ve been doing this forever, and we all trust the others. 

B messaged me yesterday saying they’d looked at M’s reddit and they’d posted on a confession reddit about having a thing for a friend and that they had secretly been enjoying ‘checking’ the friends nudes, as they had a crush on her. With screenshots from our conversations (not of my nudes, just us talking). I felt sickened. I sent them in trust that they were being sent to a friend who felt nothing emotional about them like B and C. I didn’t send them to be viewed by my friends in a pleasurable manner and felt betrayed that M had allowed me to send them my private pictures when they knew they’d get off to them. 

When confronted, M said they weren’t at fault for developing a crush for me. I didn’t have a problem with them having a thing for me, it was never and will never be reciprocated, I just wanted them to at least tell me they didn’t want to receive them anymore which I would’ve respected 100% rather than violate my trust. B is on my side and thinks M should’ve at least told one of them so she could give me heads up. C is on the fence and doesn’t want to get involved in the drama.

As a congratulations gift I told her that I would take her anywhere she wanted on vacation. I own my own company and make a bit more than she does so I can afford to do nice things for her.

She chose an African safari. She planned it all out. She chose the lodge, the excursions, even the city we would fly in and out of so that we could have a few days at a luxury hotel before and after the safari. 

Well she also decided that she liked the company of one of the other teachers at her school more than mine. It sucked but I understood. I work long hours. She wanted more attention than I could provide. It was as amicable as I could make it. 

I decided to go on the trip anyways because it sounded kind of cool and she had done all the leg work. At a Christmas party I reconnected with an old girlfriend and we got back together. I invited her on the trip. 

We went and had a great time. She posts a lot on Instagram and has like 10,000 followers. She is not an influencer or anything. She just has  good eye for taking pictures of our city and her experiences in it.  

The posts got back to my ex and when I got back she confronted me about going on the trip to spite her. I told her that I hadn't even thought of her when I decided to go, invited someone else, or was enjoying the trip. 

She said I'm an asshole because I know she will never be able to afford a trio like I just went on and that it was a dick move to take another woman on a trip she planned out. Since the trip cost about half of what she makes in a year I imagine that the first part is right. As for the second part I just thought it would be a waste to let all that planning not be used.

WIBTA if I tell my step mother to stop talking about my mom?,26,156dpit,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156dpit/wibta_if_i_tell_my_step_mother_to_stop_talking/,15,"Reposting cause I went past the character limit, oops

Hello, this is my first time posting on Reddit so I’m sorry if there’s anything wrong with my post. For privacy reasons I won’t be going into detail about some thing’s. 

My (bio) mom and my step mom (SM for now on)don’t have the best relationship. They make nice when face to face but at home they both bitch about each other to me. My mom says that SM is trying to take over her place as mine and my brothers mother, while my step mom accuses my mom of multiple crimes whenever given the chance. 

I usually just brush off SM’s accusations because I’m not confrontational and don’t wanna feed into her argument. However today she started just rapid fire accusing my mom of being horrible to me and my brother and saying we were neglected. She said that my mom chose to be a waitress and that she choose to live in a filthy house and chose to have men come in and out of her house. She even said that she remembers me telling her stories about how she wouldn’t feed us. Now, I don’t have a great memory. I admit I don’t know if I ever told SM anything about our food situation at my moms. 

I feel like she is lying. While yes, my mom did do some crappy shit that me and my brother had to go through, but it was never malicious.

I’m just so tired of her poking at my mom and saying she’s like the devil to my face. She doesn’t just do this to me. I told my brother about how she told me that my mom was bad mouthing her to her (SM’s) sister. My mom hasn’t had any contact with SM’s sister in years, and my mom has maybe 2 friends that she talks to regularly. My brother said that he tried to do this to him too and he shut her down pretty quickly. But SM told our dad and he got in trouble. 

I don’t know if this is the right thing to do. If I do this then I might lose the connection I have with my dad and my other siblings. But I can’t just stand here and let this woman talk about my mom like this. WIBTA?",1690012096.0
AITA For Not Donating To My Roommate’s Boyfriend’s GoFundMe?,561,155r1z6,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155r1z6/aita_for_not_donating_to_my_roommates_boyfriends/,243,"Not usually a Reddit user but this sub has helped me before and I’m hoping it can help again.

I (21F) am living in an apartment with Anne (19F). We live in university-style apartments where you’re assigned roommates based on compatibility, so I didn’t know Anne before she moved in late January while I was gone on a vacation. We’ve been living together 6 months now and she’s a decent person and relatively pleasant roommate most of the time. With that being said, we’re friendly, but we’re not friends. I’ve got no issue with her and I don’t think she any issue with me, we’re just both always gone from the apartment when the other is here (she’s a student + part time worker, I’m a full time worker) and we don’t have much of anything in common. We try to say we’ll hang out and do this or that, but nothing ever materializes. I know this is a bit ramble-y but it will become relevant.

A couple months ago, Anne’s bf Jon (20M) was feeling poorly. I don’t know exactly what happened, but she took him to the ER and he racked up a couple grand in medical bills. My understanding of the situation is that it wasn’t life threatening, but he needed some treatment and medication. Being a student, Jon couldn’t afford to pay the bills and my roommate has set up a GoFundMe for him. She told me about it, shared it with me, and I shared it on my social media pages to help spread the word for her and potentially get her some more donors. 

Apparently, that wasn’t good enough. Anne came up to me a couple days ago talking about her and Jon doing something and led it into the subject of his ER visit and med bills. She told me she noticed that my name wasn’t among the donors to his GFM and said if I was saving up for a bigger donation that it would be better to just split it up and donate part now because Jon is trying to make a payment before the end of the month. It got really awkward and I told her I wasn’t saving to donate because I’m trying to put all my funds together in preparation for moving across the country next week. I need money for the trip and to tide me over until I secure work. 

Anne got pissed to say the least. She said I was selfish and had no empathy if I wouldn’t even donate twenty bucks to her bf’s debt. She said if I could afford to pay my last three month’s rent at once, I could afford to spare some money for his bills that he can’t afford and that he’s poorer than me right now so I **need** to help him. Honestly, I like helping people when I’m in the position to, but I’m not. On top of that, I only somewhat know Anne and **barely** know Jon, and half of what I’ve heard about him frankly isn’t good. Including how Anne has been contemplating for a month or so about dumping him. 

I have no clue if I’m being an ass or not. Am I?

Edit: some people have brought up college-mandated health insurance requirements. I have never in my life heard of this until today. I don’t know what university Anne’s bf attends, so I don’t know they policy, but the university Anne and I attend does not require students to have health insurance and the student health center does not turn away any student that doesn’t have insurance. They urge students to have med insurance but it isn’t a rule or requirement.",1689952923.0
AITA Bailed on GF at the last minute because tired,1,1571aw3,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1571aw3/aita_bailed_on_gf_at_the_last_minute_because_tired/,12,"Gf (31f) wanted to go to a rave in the city about an hour away from where we live. She is way more into EDM than I (34m) am, but I can enjoy it in smaller doses. I originally agreed to go and bought the tickets. Fast forward a bit and a friend of hers also plans to go, another person big raver, which is fine because I was worried GF wouldn't have much fun with just me, as I said not a edm fan. 

Now here is the first problem, I get up for work at 4AM and the show wouldn't start until about 10pm(running until 2am or a bit after). I was going to be fucking exhausted by then, so I planned to take a long nap between work and then. Problem #2, around nap time, her dad dropped by to help fix our laundry (which i really appreciated, but I was given 10mins notice from GF). Took longer than expected to fix* (fixed a problem, but found out it wasn't the actual issue with it.) So now it's 7ish and I get ready. Problem #3 GF's friend doesn't drive (DUI) and needs to be picked up and dropped off after, she lives about 30 mins in the opposite direction. GF did pick up her friend after getting ready while I tried to caffinate and sneak in a quick nap.

She gets back, it's now about 9pm. I downed a C4 and got about 40mins of shut eye, but I was still just not rallying.

Looking down the barrel of 1 hour to get there, city parking, 3-4 hours of EDM, another 2ish hours of driving (to drop off friend and get home), and already not feeling it. I told her that I wouldn't be any fun if I went.

I felt that because she had her friend with her she wouldn't be alone ( a major reason I agreed to go in the first place), and told her I'd come and get them after if they needed (I'd sleep while they're out) 

She seemed fine leaving, and seems to agree more after the fact as the place was hot and tightly pact (something I would have bailed on immediately in person)

She doesn't seem upset, but I feel guilty and like I was being selfish for not joining in on something she really enjoys

AITA For telling my mom u don't want to talk to her after I move out of her house,2,156w3dm,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156w3dm/aita_for_telling_my_mom_u_dont_want_to_talk_to/,16,"For a bit of backstory 

When my mom and dad divorced, my mom went through I guess you can an discovering phase. She began to focus on herself more WHICH IS A GOOD THING, but I've noticed she doesn't hold my priorities up with hers. Like if I need to go to the dentist or the doctor, she'll say she will make the appointment but she won't. Then I remind her, and she'll get mad that I said something about it, but the appointment will still not be made. When it comes to her she has her appointments in, within a week. I still haven't gotten the physical I needed.

Growing up she used to yell and scream at me and my sisters a lot, she still does, we grew up not exactly poor but we were lower middle class. So I was accustomed to hearing no a lot. So when I got to be around 15 I just stopped asking for stuff, because it would result in her yelling at me. I told myself that I would get a job so I don't have to ask her for anything, it's a reason why I don't like asking or receiving something from someone, because I'll feel selfish.

I wanted Burger King, she said why, I saw that was an indicator for no so I was like oh ok that's fine I don't need it. She speeds to Burger King buys me what I want, then tells me I could've made it at home. But I told her it's ok, she already said no, so I wasn't going to argue. She doesn't believe me when I say it's ok or it's fine or don't worry about it, I think she thinks I'm being sarcastic even though I tell her I'm not.

I get good grades, I'm not disrespectful, I CLEAN the house. I'm mostly in my room.

My dad recently got mad at me because I don't ask my stepmom for anything. I only ask him, because he's the only one I'm comfortable asking for stuff and even then I have to pump myself up ask.  She felt like she was neglecting me because I don't ask for anything, but I'm just trying make sure that she doesn't do anything she doesn't want to do. If I want burger king I don't want to ask cause she works 9-5 and I understand she tired just like my mom so I don't ask. They tell me it's okay to ask for things I want but it's hard because I don't want to ask for something, they do it but be mad or uncomfortable the entire time. I'd rather ask when your more up for it. 

I honestly think my mom's trying to live her best life, I think she feels she has control and I'm happy for her, but I honestly just feel like burden and she tells me sometimes I do things that makes things harder for her. She deserves does happiness, she's gone through a lot.

I will always love my mom but I don't think I want to have a relationship with her. Whenever I talk to her I immediately feel uncomfortable and want to stop talking, but maybe I'm being selfish. I feel numb in that house.

I think I really hurt her feelings maybe I went to far.",1690061911.0

We reluctantly started and it was unsettling but not creepy then she insisted on tounge kissing if you got the same person 2 times in a row me and my sister got uncomfortable and stopped playing. 

Then Jen was sent to our house for a week. We where not worried about her trying anything cause she would get kicked out. Then I decided we should go to the mall with my friend Roxie. When we got there Jen was trying to always be with Roxie and making up lies about other people so Roxie could sit with her. When they were on a ride together Jen would say creepy stuff on how ""what's your type Roxie cause your mine"" and stuff like that. When we got back to my house Jen announced that they were dating alam bells where going off in my head. I took Roxie aside and she revealed that she was very uncomfortable and we made a plan for Roxie to break up with her on the 4th of July. The next day my sister wanted to go to the water park. When we got there Jen was being all nice complimenting sage and being an ass hole to me. When Roxie and Jen were on the waterslide and Jen was saying 'I love you' to Roxie (even though they met a day ago) and making her super uncomfortable. At the fourth of July Roxie finally broke it off then Jen threw a hissy fit in an Arby's. The rest of the week Jen was just being a horrible person even my other friend said she was annoying. 

Now to present day I felt guilty for letting it happen and told my mom everything and now Jen is in big big trouble.

Roxie was sleeping over to spend time with me and my sister.
Jen had a boyfriend
I asked if Roxie wanted to leave and she didn't want to

After being asked, I thought it would be reasonable to explain my decision-making, and so I did. I explained that after working for almost a year in a part-time job that was getting me to nowhere I realized that I am getting too comfortable with the life I was having at the time, and the thought of continuing in this path made me uncomfortable, so I decided that even if I am not 100% sure that what I am choosing to study is what I actually want, I will do it because I rather make decision while moving, instead of waiting to make the perfect decision. Which I said that I think would be impossible without actually experiencing something.  I also explained that as long as I am not making any irrational decision (IE studying something I know for sure that I have no interest in) I definitely believe in this kind of decision-making, and I tried to suggest that perhaps if they feel so much uncertainty, maybe they need a ""leap of faith/first push"" to start getting things going.  


After explaining myself, I seemed to have gotten a few of them somewhat mad, they argued that I am not a life coach, and that I was being irrational because in their opinion such a decision has to be done in a perfect manner and that taking your time and not rushing is justifiable, I agreed and said that such an idea resonates with me, as long as the time being taken to make the decision is not too long, and the decision that has been made was not irrational.  


One of the people that were there got noticeably mad at me and kept arguing her position, I understood that I may have been rude for my behavior and took a bit of a passive approach. I gave her the time she needed to speak what was on her mind and didn't counter argue any further. Even so, she left early, and I have a feeling it may have been because of what I said, this thought has been bothering me for a while now so I came here to ask if I should feel bad about what I said

So, it is common practice to accompany your friends, especually female, from or to their transport.

However, I live downtown, really next to the subway (literally around the corner, a 40-second walk). At night it's never safe for a woman, but during the day, with everything open, there is no danger at all.

My girlfriend lives far from me. I've been to her city plenty of times and I have no problem with taking the trip to see her. However, we end up meeting more around here because I don't live with my parents and because there's more to do where I live.

My gf keeps asking me to pick her up from the subway and I don't see the point. I have to get up, get dressed, face the cold and deal with the anxiety of paying attention to the exact moment in which she's arriving just to walk with her for half a block.

I've lived in different neighborhoods in which the subway was much further away, and I always walked with her because it's boring and kind of dangerous. Not the case anymore. Seriously, one of the major factors when choosing an apartment is ""will I have to escort people when they visit me?"" Because I hate it so much.

I feel annoyed, I need an explanation for that need. I don't think ""because it's important to her"" suffices. I have a lot of reasons why I hate doing that - ADHD, not wanting to deal with timetables unnecessarily, the sheer pointlessness of it, the cold, anxiety regarding leaving the apartment, feeling like I'm doing it just because of emotional blackmail, etc.

AITA for proving I was right?,1031,155lgh3,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155lgh3/aita_for_proving_i_was_right/,167,"I, (27f) planned a trip with my friends, K (29f), R (30m), M (30m), C (30M), and my fiance J (31m). It was planned many months ago since it's a yearly thing most of us attend. This would be Cs first time coming. We go to a convention for pop culture in the north east, and C showed interest in going. So I reached out and the group was cool with him coming.

I told him since the hotels are super expensive during convention time, we usually all share a large suite and split the cost, if he was interested in sharing with us. He agreed. I explained we usually leave Thursday night and come home the Monday morning, and this time would be the same. He acknowledged and paid his split.

Come the months leading up to the trip, I follow up with C to make sure we're all good. No issues. The day we pick him up, he was surprised to hear we don't come home Sunday night. I had told him I mentioned that when we booked the hotel, but he was firm that I did not, and that I severely inconvenienced him since now he would need to call off work. I felt bad that he forgot, and offered him to back out and we'd reimburse him. He grumbled and called his job, who said it was okay to take Monday off. 

And I thought that was that. But no, almost the whole time, no matter how much we tried to include him in our road trip shenanigans, he was pouting. At the next rest stop, I asked him if he was okay, to which he said ""No this is one of the worst evenings ever. I was told last minute about coming home Monday."" 

This really upset me cos I was trying to make this an enjoyable weekend for all. And angry because I KNOW I told him. I spoke with my fiance, who said I was right and that I did many times, but to let it be.

Come this morning, I just had to know if I did or didn't, and looking at the messages, I found it. Right under the hotel info. Said many times. I screen shotted it, pointed at him like that monkey in family guy and tossed the phone on him bed (he was already awake). He looked. And just said very annoyed, ""I don't care, just remind me next time"". And i think now doesnt wanna talk to me. Was I the asshole for not letting it go?

Edit: holy heck I didn't think people would care so much for something like this. Thank you all for telling me that I wasn't being crazy about this. We are about 3 hours away and he's low on money. He did calm down and we spoke about it. Expressed how it still was a dick move to put a lot on me, and as someone said, I'm not his mom. Well, he didn't like that but accepted what I said. He eventually calmed down, but I definitely needed space from him at the convention. Thanks again for the support!",1689939360.0
AITA for threatening my little sister's highly anticipated summer trip due to her repeated negligence of type 1 diabetes?,2,156vhjl,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156vhjl/aita_for_threatening_my_little_sisters_highly/,18,"My sister (14) was diagnosed with T1 when she was a baby. Obviously the whole family had to learn how to care for her. As she is getting older we are trying to transition towards her independence with diabetes and I've pushed for even more responsibility on her as she starts high school this year. I bought airline tickets for her and her brother to visit friends across the country for a bit before school starts. She has done decently well with accepting greater responsibility and I'm proud of her. However, she wants to be a normal teenager and have sleepovers, go to the movies, etc. But she forgets to count her carbs or check her blood sugar, which is on an app on her phone, which she is on 24/7. Our deal is that she needs to let me know that she is aware that her sugar level is increasing or decreasing and what she is doing to remedy it so I don't have to worry or continuously spam her phone with messages and calls. She hates this and is inconsistent. Over the last week there has been a pattern of me having to wake her up for her to eat because her sugar levels got way too low. She doesn't hear the alarm on her phone all the time. Two days ago she asked to sleep at her friend's. I reminded her that she hasn't been waking up and I didn't think it was a good idea but I also want her to enjoy her life and spend time with her friends. We reached a deal that she would text me updates, answer the phone if I called to help wake her up and gave me her friend's number and her friends mother's number just in case. If she did not keep the deal her future summer trip would be suspended as I can't trust her to keep control over her diabetes for one night, much less more. She texted me her plan but the next morning did not wake up to her app alarms, or my 10 phone calls to try and help get her up. Her friend didn't answer her phone the two times I tried that and the mother didn't answer the other two times I called. It was around 7am so a little early but I was beyond frustrated and worried. Eventually the mother called me back and woke up my sister so she could take care of it. I said this is evidence she isn't responsible enough and I wouldn't be letting her go. She claims this isn't fair, she is a deep sleeper and since nothing bad happened she should still be able to go. She also claims that her friend kept reaching over and silencing both phones and thought they were just alarms. 

I told her no but she has the remaining time between now and her flight to try and change my mind. I just want her to be more responsible over something she has to live with. AITA for keeping her from her trip? She has had a countdown for it since February and it's her best friend and family she hasn't seen in a couple of years. 

*her blood sugar levels that morning were too high, so she would not be in a altered mental status and is able to completely understand what is happening. When she is too low its a different story but she still needs a plan and a way to get her sugar level up. With or without me there.",1690060417.0

Now, I know the sale is ""priced in"", but $2 each sounded like a pretty good deal.  Just to verify the deal, I looked at their ad to make sure it said the same thing.  I picked out my two and continued shopping. 

When it came time to check out, the cantaloupes rang up for $3 each.  Perplexed I asked the cashier why they rang up for that and she states ""They're $6 each, but our system takes $3 off each to make one free"".  I mentioned the sign saying $3.99 and she immediately called her manager over and met her half way only to run off to the produce section.  Working in retail before, that typically means they think I'm some AH and they want to talk away from me so I wouldn't make a scene.  And I get it, some random dude arguing over $2 might seem nuts to them, but if I'm going to pay extra I would have just got them at the local produce store instead. 

They came back and the manager said ""The sign says save *at least $3.99.,* but you're saving $6 which is a better savings"".  I asked if there were any other types of cantaloupes in case I just missed the ones for $3.99.  ""Nope, we only carry one type of cantaloupe"".  Sure enough, in the tiniest font available at the printers it says *at least*. At this point I realized that 1) its a pretty shady advertisement 2) it isn't the cashier's fault.  I said ""Na, I'm good.  Can you remove the two cantaloupes?  I don't need them"". 

Here's where the AITA starts...The manager starts to walk away and says ""God, some people just don't want to save money"".  I should have let it go, but that statement just rubbed me the wrong way.  I said ""What do you mean?"".  She said ""You're throwing a fit and we're GIVING you 2 extra dollars"". I mentioned it seemed to me that I would be giving them the 2 extra dollars. ""Sir, you're clearly saving $6 which is better than $4.  I don't understand what you're not getting"".  At this point I told them to cancel the whole order and left the store. 

My wife said I was an AH for leaving without putting the food back.  I felt like it was justified by the attitude after the removal of the cantaloupes.  AITA?",1690046453.0
AITA For Not Telling My Parents I Got Plastic Surgery Until After I Got It?,143,1561qyj,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1561qyj/aita_for_not_telling_my_parents_i_got_plastic/,108,"My (F24) parents and I are arguing a lot lately. I've lived away from home for about 5 years now and it's been great. 

I got a nosejob around spring of last year. It was something I wanted since my early teens and I saved up a lot of money, working extra hours to get something that I felt would make me more confident. It was a success and I'm much happier these days. 

6 or 7 months or so ago I told my parents I got it, and the last month they're coming out of the blue saying how hurt they were that I didn't tell them prior to getting it. 

My mom likened it to how she told me of a recent cancer scare she had (luckily she's fine), which I didn't feel was a fair comparison. A completely safe surgery that had a week long recovery tops just didn't seem the same as potentially having cancer. 

The reason I hadn't told them was because they're sorta old fashioned and I didn't want to deal with the stress of potential judgement during the leadup to getting it as I was already nervous. I feel like you can be as public or private about plastic surgery as you like, but I don't know if that's an unfair opinion. 

They effectively want me to concede that I was arrogant for not telling them in order for our relationship to be ""healthy"" again.

AITA for putting my feelings over my boyfriends?,5,156ns3h,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156ns3h/aita_for_putting_my_feelings_over_my_boyfriends/,8,"Currently, I (F20) am a bit stressed. I have an exam on monday, my first graded exam in university. It's in maths, so it's a lot of topics I needed to study for. I've learnt for 2-3 weeks, preparing everything I need to know while trying to maintain a work-life- balance so I won't overdo myself. It sometimes still happened that I got stressed and undervalued everything i did till now. It happens, my mental stability is not the best. [I had a hard time before with depression] But I'm trying to get better with it. I'm not handling it like i used to. I think I grew stronger. Nevertheless the moments I DO get anxious, I feel overwhelmed trying to maintain everything with planning stuff to stay focused. For example: I'm stressed that I don't have enough time to learn everything: I make a plan when to learn what topic. This has helped me a lot. 

Okay now to what happened. Sorry for the long Intro. My bf (M24) and I played some video games and I said to him that I wanted to play till 2 pm to stay in my planned time. He begged for one more round even it was 2 pm already. I accepted it and played even tho it stressed me abit. Then we cooked together. I wanted to be as fast as we can so I asked him to help me here and there (kind of saying like: Can you do this and can you do that.) He got so frustrated. We got into a huge fight. He said that I am stressing him with all of that and that he feels so incredibly bad the last 2 weeks of how stressed I am. I told him that I'm really trying my best, but also said that he needs to accept it at times like this, it'll be over on Monday. He then confronted me and said that: 'YOU need to handle it and NOT ME. You need to learn how to deal with stress. '

I get the point, like he is right. I am stressing my surroundings with plans and timelines that they don't have. But I couldn't believe only this one thing that happened was so stressful so to him, so I proceeded to ask what happened that he is stressed since 2 weeks bc of me. He couldn't really answer it, said 1-3 things that had happened but not in a timespan of 2 weeks. Now in these situations like today i want him specifically to accept it even tho it frustrates him too how I act. 

Am I the asshole for putting my feelings over his? 

Add on: He is cooking for us everyday and cleaning so I have more time to study. Like that's also why I didn't understand that reaction of him.",1690041445.0

But the topic of this post started with a trip I wanted to take with all of them. I asked O, A, S and V if they wanted to go. Unfortunately V was going to be in a different country on the dates of the trip. When I asked O it was before we drifted and she didn’t give me a yes or no answer so I didn’t bother asking her again. S and A also were very vague about their answer and I didn’t even get a definite no from them until a week before the trip. I ended up taking my mom and 2 of my aunts to the trip making me switch reservations last minute. 

The other situation was I wanted to have a bit of a get together on my birthday to watch a movie, again I asked S, A and V. Both S and A said they couldn’t go but didn’t tell me why. V went with me to watch the movie despite her only getting back from her trip 2 days ago and fighting bad jetlag. 

A few days after my birthday, V planed a hangout inviting S, A, O and me. Everyone went and we had fun. 

After that I asked V if she wanted to come to my place just to watch movies and eat snacks because we haven’t done it in a while. I never bothered to invite S and A because I wanted it to just be me and V and also because they probably would have said no. 

That night V posted an Instagram story of me sitting on my couch beside her and another picture of the movie we were watching. After V left I opened my phone to many messages from S and A about how I never bothered to invite them.

This was in a group chat with me, S, A and V. I responded to them saying I just wanted to hang out with V and they didn’t miss much it was just a small movie marathon. They then told me how I never invite them anywhere and I was obviously picking favourites with V. I told them that I do invite them but they always have an excuse and that they also never invite me anywhere and how I don’t feel the need to invite them if they are just going to say no. They called me an asshole for not doing my part of the friendship by not making plans with them.

My wife (27F) and I have a son (6). We own a 3 bedroom house with a good amount of land along with a guest house which we rent out. My younger brother is currently going to school in the town I live in as it has a good course to set him in the right direction for his career path, he is currently living with us as my parents house is a hours drive from the school and we had an extra bedroom. 

I had recently had some of my extended family over to catch up. A few days ago we were out for breakfast when my uncle (let’s call mark) had mentioned something about my cousin (22M) (we’ll call him Jake) getting the opportunity for a plumbing apprenticeship in the area and not having the money but needing a place to stay, mark suggested jake staying in the guest house, I reminded mark the guest house currently was being rented. Mark said I stop renting to the people who live there and let Jake stay instead but I explained I can’t kick the couple who lives there out just so my cousin can live there rent free. That’s when my aunt Sarah chimes in and suggests my brother shares a room with my son and Jake stays in Brother's old room.
I told them I wasn’t going to make my brother and son share a room just so my cousin who got kicked out of college could move in. They said this is apprenticeship is a good opportunity for Jake, I replied telling them if they want him to do the apprenticeship then they could pay for the first months rent for an apartment, after that he would be able to pay for it himself with the money he would earn from the apprenticeship, or he could sell his fancy new car I’ve seen him posting and bragging about and use the money from that to pay rent. They told me I’m being selfish and need grow up, after that i had, had enough and got up payed my part of the bill and left. 
Later that day I got a text from my aunt saying how I behaved poorly and that after I left everyone agreed I was being selfish along with multiple other messages and missed calls telling me I need to grow up and accept that Jake will be moving in with me, my cousin also messaged and called me childish. I also got a message from my sister saying the rest of the family is on my side and Sarah and Mark were wrong for putting me in that position at breakfast and left shortly after I did. After that I sent the following message to my aunt, uncle and cousin “while I understand you may be frustrated with me, my decision stands, I will not be letting Jake move in. I can’t just evict the tenants living in the guest house. (They’re also a very nice couple me and my wife have become friends with) I don’t see why I should have to let Jake live with me and pay no rent. He’s made his life choices and it was not my fault he got kicked out of college and fired from his job”

I (nb, then 18) got off at my station after school and picked up my bicycle. My knee was hurting pretty bad It slowly started hurting in class and kept increasing as I made my way home. At that point the pain was already so severe that I couldn’t ride my bicycle anymore so I decided to use it as a help to walk.
In the process I started crying from the immense pain and finally decided to call my dad, asking him to pick me up.
My parents are divorced, but as it was my brothers birthday I knew he was at my mothers house, she was still at work at the time. I called him crying trying to explain my situation, meanwhile also rain started pouring down on me.
My dad immediately shut me down and started yelling how it’s my brothers birthday today I shouldn’t try to make this about myself and I can walk just fine. He quickly hung up on me after that.
I decided to then call my mother, knowing she’d get off work soon.
With much hesitation she said she would get me but told me to keep walking and she will pick me up on the way.
After a long time she finally showed up, loaded my bicycle and told me to stop crying. I was at the point where I couldn’t even move my leg anymore because of the pain.
Arriving home I tried to go upstairs to my room, still crying from pain, and just be alone. No one took my pain seriously so I was just gonna shut up.
My father then came to my room to look at my leg, basically diagnosing me as being dramatic. My knee was very heated and liquid started to form but he brushed it off and again said that i’m just trying to ruin my brothers birthday.
Fast forward to later in the evening I mentioned I can’t go to school the next day it just hurt so bad. I couldn’t walk anymore.
My dad shut my idea down and said he will personally make sure I go to school.
He told me that he will show up the next morning at 7am, pick up a pair of crutches for me, since i was being so dramatic, and drive me to school.
So that’s what he did.
30 minutes into class i couldn’t take the pain anymore and I asked the teacher to make a call.
I called my parents crying asking them to pick me up. They just breaded me and told me to just get over it already.
After a while into the call my Teacher came out to check on me. She told me to just hang up on my parents and that’d she would get me a ride home or to the hospital.
The school secretary then drove me home.
I called my doctor once I was home for an appointment. Long story short, after my doctor saw me she immediately sent me to the hospital.
Turns out I ruptured my meniscus and my outer ligaments. 
I had more than 6 months physiotherapy to finally use my right leg properly again. Even now I an still very affected daily by this injury.

My wife has only her mom. Dad passed long ago and no siblings. They are very close and her mom has been with us about 50% of the last four years helping out with our kids. 

Her mom is nice but I have issues with her. She is a bad communicator, like literally mumbles all the time which is especially bad because I’m communicating with her in what’s not my native language and it is very difficult for me to understand. I constantly tell her to speak up and speak clearly and she just kind of giggles. Rude. 

Anyway, I try not to make a big issue of it (or that she’s super pessimistic, or that she talks with her mouth full of food, or a million other things) because I know she’s family now. It’s on me to put up with it.

I (19NB) was invited to play Minecraft with a friend I recently met (and their friend who I'll call T) and another bunch of people whom I don't know. We were in a voice chat with my friend and T.

I joined the server late and had to travel to their location for around 15 minutes after which I got knocked into a really deep hole by T (as a joke which they both laughed at) and died, I didn't set my spawn point since I didn't know you could do it during the day.

Since it took so long to get there and I didn't have the motivation to travel all the way back, I asked someone to teleport me but nobody responded, so I told them I'm leaving after which T said ""are you one of those tiktok users?"", after which I said no and asked him ""why didn't you ask me if I had set my spawn?"", he said that he expected me to have done it and called me cringe for wanting to leave.

I still ended up leaving as I would've felt too awkward staying, but I have nothing to do for the rest of the day and I'm feeling really lonely, maybe I should apologize to them.",1690050281.0
AITA for ignoring my bestfriend after she disrespected my SO?,4,156nalk,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156nalk/aita_for_ignoring_my_bestfriend_after_she/,11,"I (22F) recently got into a altercation with my bestfriend (22F).

 Some back ground:
I am a registered nurse and my SO is currently an unemployed tutor/aspiring teacher. We recently had 2 week trip to New York. I paid for 70-80% of the trip because I make significantly more than my SO (I felt that it was fair to pay our percentage of the trip while factoring income). I also had planned to move into a new apartment right after my trip. 

Best friend was my high-school bully who apologized post high school and we became close friends. 

So the story goes.. best friend and I, were having a causal conversation about my trip to New York and  my financial situation. I expressed that I was stressed about finances because I had spent quite a bit on the trip and on the new apartment. She asked how much I spent in New York and I told her x amount. She then proceeds to ask why didn’t my SO pay for any of it. I told her that he is currently unemployed at this time because of the trip and also cause of the transitioning school year. She then states out of nowhere, “what a little bitch, what a little boy. He should be able to provide for you because he is able-bodied and he is just being lazy.” She hardly knows my SO and how he is studying for his CSET. I calmly told her that he has his reasons and at this time his focus is job searching and studying. Then she says, “well at my tutoring job, there is a tenured teacher there who has to work part time at a tutoring place to make ends meet. He has to understand that as a teacher he is going to be so busy and ‘taking it easy’ right now is not going to prepare him.” After a lot of back and forth, I was able to change the subject. 

I thought she liked my SO, but this blindsided me. I felt like she disrespected my SO and also my decisions. She also weaponized someone else’s achievements as a tenured professor to dog on my SO. Later that night, I brought this up to her via text. She apologized for calling him profanities, but double down what she said. She said “I will always take the girl’s side. I hate men, even if my brother brought home a girl, I’ll take the girl’s side.” “It is not like a hate him, I am still willing to offer a job at my tutoring place if he is interested.”

She didn’t seem to understand the gravity of her words.. and I honestly don’t want anything to do with her. She is messaging me at this time, wanting to talk things out, but I’m just fed up. I am choosing to ignore her. AITA?",1690040261.0
AITA for reporting my ex’s baby daddy to child services?,4,156n64q,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156n64q/aita_for_reporting_my_exs_baby_daddy_to_child/,16,"Long time reader, first time poster. 
My ex (21 F )and I (24 M) have been separated for roughly 1 year now but have kept in regular contact and have been close throughout the past year. Our split was amicable due to different career paths and locations making it difficult for our relationship to continue. 
She moved on fairly quickly in finding another partner to whom she has fallen pregnant and has now given birth to their child. Her new partner is already divorced with 4 children and this makes 5, throughout the past year my ex has expressed concerns about the other children’s welfare as the house they live in is not large enough and the children are often sick with many of them not having regular meals and are constantly in the hospital. My ex and child live away from her partner and other children but visit occasionally and sometimes stay the night. Recently the two have split but have stayed on talking terms for the sake of their newborn child together.
Tonight my ex asked me to call to have a vent after having a rough day to which I obliged but we were interrupted by the newborn needing feeding. Later in the evening I tried calling her again after seeing a worrying story on social media about being done with deadbeat baby daddy. 
The first two attempts at calling rang out, the third call was picked up instantly to the sound of crying children and my ex begging, baby daddy had picked up the call and began a string of obscenities and threats to the tone of “don’t call here again” and “stay away or else”, 
In the background I can hear my ex begging him to hang up the phone and to leave it alone. 
After sitting and listening I asked to speak to my ex which was met with more threats and promises of violence. 
After hanging up my ex messaged me to apologise and said that baby daddy has been drinking and turned depressive and unstable. 
I called my ex’s mother and expressed concerns for her safety and the mother has gone to pick her up. 
At this point being fed up with the treatment of my ex and her child not to mention the other 4 children being neglected I called child services and gave them the details to which they promised they would investigate. 

I hate to put more children out of their homes but this deadbeat cannot be trusted to care for these kids.

AITA for refusing to attend a friend’s wedding because of the color scheme?,19,156dqyi,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156dqyi/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_a_friends_wedding/,157,"so, i got into this fight with my friend, and now it feels like the whole world is against me.

i, 22F, am fighting with my close friend from childhood, G, 21F. me and G have been inseparable since age 14. we are two very different souls, to put it lightly. i’ve been planning my wedding since i was little, knowing every detail down to the style of lace on my dress. G didn’t even plan on getting married. when talking about her engagement to her girlfriend/fiancé L, she says “it just happened.”

i’ll admit it can drive me crazy to think this wedding is so unplanned, but to each their own. she’s having a small ceremony (L’s family aren’t supportive of queer marriage so it’s mostly close friends + G’s parents) a couple of states away. 

they’re getting married in this small venue that’s in a little forest area. when they proposed this idea, i thought it was a little odd, but whatever. their cat is going to be the ring bearer, weird (but cute) to me but again, it’s their wedding. all was fine, unconventional but fine, until they showed me the colors.

i’m not kidding. i know it sounds ridiculous but the colors they chose are god awful. it’s this neon yellow/greenish color, dark orange (kind of brownish), and mint green. it is seriously the most hideous palette of colors i have ever seen.

i know it’s shallow but those colors are so uncomfortable to look at. i expressed this to G, saying it would be hard to make a nice venue with this scheme, and she brushed it off. i let it go for the time being, but spending every waking moment looking for dehydrated piss, sad feces, and mint effing green colored decorations was weighing on me.

they showed up in my dreams. i wish i was kidding, and i wish i could say this was all made up, but no. i was having dreams where the rainbow was made up of these three colors and had this twisted, horrific smile under its dead eyes. i’ve always had pretty weird dreams, but this has got to take the cake. it sounds so stupid but it was genuinely terrifying.

when i told this to G, she laughed. i told her i was serious and she kept laughing. i was pretty offended that she laughed at a genuine comment i was making, and told her i wouldn’t go to the wedding if the color scheme remained. she told me i was overreacting and to take a day or two to calm down, so we left each other alone as to not provoke each other.

i’m sure it’ll work out somehow, but i have to know: AITA for refusing to go to my friend’s wedding because of the color scheme?

Edit: so, funny story, i didn’t actually read any of these comments until just now. i already talked to G because i realized how, even though she didn’t really care, what i said was kind of insensitive. G was fine with it and said that she chose unconventional colors on purpose. also, i swear i wasn’t trying to be condescending about her other choices, i was trying to highlight just how unconventional the rest of the wedding was. her cat being the ring bearer is actually really cute and maybe the lesbian-ist choice she could have made, second only to getting gay married. G was fine with it, and said she was mostly concerned with how neurotic id been about the whole thing. so i booked a therapy appointment to figure out why this whole thing bothers me so much, and me and G are doing fine :)",1690012233.0
AITA for wanting to live abroad?,8,156k0rc,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156k0rc/aita_for_wanting_to_live_abroad/,8,"I had a best friend for 10 years who I was inseparable with (he’s gay) I was always there for him w his mental health, and while I try to figure stuff out on my own, any time I had something going on, he made it about himself and I didn’t feel supported. He demanded oyalty and had his friends essentially become enemies with anyone who dared wrong him.

We both wanted to live abroad and he did for an internship few years back, we stayed in touch. Fast-forward to 2019, moved to the US from my home country for grad school. We didn’t stay in touch as much, mainly because I was busy and didn’t make as much of an effort to reach out, and never did. 

In 2020 I went home for quarantine, and we talked regularly, but when I went back to the US, that stopped. I had a life in the US that I was happy with, I had great friends, I was living closer to my LD boyfriend, and my career was promising. 

I got a job in NYC and moved there after graduation, planning to stay with a work visa. I applied to hundreds of jobs, and shared everything on TikTok. I couldn’t find a visa in time, and had to move back. Now, this country  has huge inequality, safety, and poverty issues. I was privileged and went to a private university with help from parents, loans & scholarships, I’m not rich and struggled through school. But I had an education that opened doors.

I didn’t want to stay in this country as there’s organized crime and petty theft even in the capital, where you have to walk your dog in flip flops without jewelry, any nice watch, or your phone. On top of that, this country pays very poorly and lacks opportunity in my field. 

I got used to life in the US, and while I had scholarships, I had to take out loans, sell homemade food, walk dogs, & had a job to support myself, it still felt easier than home. Having “failed” at a job visa sent me on a spiral, all the while sharing my experience on social media. After a few months home, I posted saying that while I knew I could technically stay and live a privileged life in a nice apartment in a safer part of town, that felt like settling and I wanted more. I never once mentioned anyone or spoke ill about anyone on that post. 

This offended my ex-bsf. He saw the post, liked hate comments, and went on a rampage on Tw, subtweeting me but not talking to me directly. He said I was selfish, self-centered, and thought I was better than everyone else. This went on until we met up at another friend’s house for their birthday, and that day solidified that my friend truly hated me. He was cold, spoke over me, and was super mean-girly towards me, trying to establish that this was HIS group and I didn’t belong. I felt uncomfy and went home quickly. I then noticed he had unfollowed me from a couple places on social. 

Now, there was never a conversation about this, and I don’t know where this reaction came from. I never attacked anyone or acted like I was better for wanting to live abroad. So AITA?",1690032062.0
AITA for getting a cat without my dad's permission?,2,156tv75,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156tv75/aita_for_getting_a_cat_without_my_dads_permission/,12,"For background: I live with a very large family. On paper, the house belongs to my mom, but my stepdad makes all the financial/family decisions. My parents and baby sister haven't been in the house for 2-3 months and have been staying at a hotel (for reasons I'd rather not go into). After that, they're planning on moving to the new, bigger house when it's finished with construction, so they won't even be in the house I'm living in.

&#x200B;

My family saw I'm a bit stressed since this all happened, since I'd have to manage the family businesses, bills, etc... if my dad ended up going to jail. I've been juggling full-time work, college, a ton of mental health issues, and stress from recent events. Everyone who's living with me told me it was alright if I could get a cat to comfort me. My mom visits the house often, but my dad can't, so I told her to convince my dad to see if it was alright to get a cat when she came over.

&#x200B;

My paternal step-grandma has allergies, but she comes over to babysit my little brother, so I asked her if it was okay if I could keep the cat in my room/my uncle's room when she came over. After that, I adopted a cat. My grandparents, mom, and little sister were there when we got her; my uncle loves her; and I thought my step-grandma was okay with it, but my mom told me she was complaining about the cat and saying she won't babysit anymore if the cat stays. My step-grandma is normally really honest and upfront about what she feels, so I thought she was okay with it. We have a really good relationship outside of this issue, though, so I think she didn't want to tell me 'no' straight to my face.

&#x200B;

Then, I learn my dad is angry with me because he didn't know about the cat. I'll be honest---I'm not good at communication. I often assume people know the things I know without telling them, so when I talk to people I leave out details since I forget that they don't know what I know. I can't understand when people talk in anyway that isn't straight to the point. I honestly assumed that he knew, but we don't communicate a lot (we can go for weeks/months without speaking). I often get my mom to communicate with him through her since he likes to make jokes, but I'm bad at understanding sarcasm and humor unless it's overt, so our relationship is sort of strained since I'm awful at being able to understand if he's serious or joking or mad or happy.

&#x200B;

On one hand, I understand why he's upset since I got a cat without his knowledge. On the other hand, I feel that, since he doesn't live here, and I'm taking care of the cat's needs (financially and daily) and have obtained permission from others who lived in this house, it should be fine. I am biased due to developing an emotional attachment to the cat.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - I'm living in one of my parents' houses and adopted a cat without my dad's permission. ",1690056405.0

During this meeting, I outlined all the issues I had last year without directly naming people. This was followed up by me saying that for this reason, I will be blocking two class numbers from participating. When I said this it was a universal oh-shit moment amongst the Comp Sci department as they don't know each other's class numbers.

I became good and now I do professional photos, and of course I’m the first to call when a friend wants to do a session. I did one for my best friend (24f) and she loved my work and told me she’d love for me to take her pictures when she gets married, which flattered me so much. One day her mother in law got married and I was one of the bridesmaids, I told her my gift for her would be my pictures, but I was uncomfortable and felt like an employee instead of a guess and couldn’t enjoyed the ceremony, because of that if I know the bride and the groom I don’t accept the job.

My best friend is getting married this year and I’m one the bridesmaids, she knows my opinion about being her photographer and she understands. I took her engagement pictures and she and the groom loved them. A couple of weeks ago she sat down with me and asked if I could take the pictures and she told me it would be either before or after the ceremony and only pictures of them and that she would even paid me, because wedding photographers are really expensive (which I agree) and they are saving to buy a house because theirs caught on fire, if it wasn’t because of that they would hire one. I told her I was going to think about it but I haven’t given her an answer. 

Even if I were to do this I couldn’t just take pictures of them, a wedding is something special and I would make sure to capture every moment, also because they have been very special with me and I believe we’re gonna be friends forever, but all this means I wouldn’t be a bridesmaid. 

Another reason I don’t want to do it is because of the groom’s family, they are very toxic and they would treat me as an employee, and they would get mad at me for not wanting to take their pictures and criticize me for it or my job, the wedding is already a bit controversial and I don’t want to add more drama. Also I’m scared of a malfunction of my camera could occur and she wouldn’t have any pictures of the day since she doesn’t want guests to use their phones.

side note: she keeps a note about the men she’s been with and i hear it’s large so i believed i could joke about this. 

i reply to her with “ye Fair enough” as i didn’t want to be too confrontational. i then followed it up with a little joke about her “track record,” no offense, as it makes me question her intentions. her response was, ”thanks 🙃.” i then replied, “you’re welcome” as i believed i have tricked her in the marketplace of jokes. 

however she left me on read so i brought upon a previous situation to prove my point by saying, “i did hear about when our friend was leaving town and you took a little leave of absence.” (i wasn’t there though this is all second hand) basically what i’m referring to is when one of our other friends came into town and May left early to go fuck her neighbor. 

i felt as if i offended her because she left me on read again! so i reply “but i mean i can’t judge, you be doing you.” as an apology because i understand i could have made her upset. she left me on read again so i try to apologize again with “ps im not trying to sound like a judgy dick, just putting in my 2 cents.” as i am not trying to hurt her feelings. she STILL left me on read so i continued “yea, sorry my bad if i upset you” i then thought this wasn’t sufficient enough so i apologized for the third time, “my bad, was just trying to joke and poke fun a bit but came across of really judgmental and bitchy, sorry.” May didn’t reply and even took a screenshot of the convo a day later.

My mother moved across the country for work with one of my brothers a little over a month ago while my dad, my other brother and I stayed behind for various reasons. We’re going to visit my mother in a couple weeks and staying for about a week. We had this trip planned before we got the kitten but he decided to get it anyway and didn’t tell my mom.
I knew he planned to leave the older two cats alone and have my uncle come and check on them, i didn’t really like the idea of leaving them alone but i didn’t have any say in it so i dealt with it but now he wants to leave the kitten home with them.
she’s not very old and is still in the “cute tiny kitten” stage
I got angry at him and yelled at him saying he can’t just leave a kitten home alone for an entire week and he blew up at me saying that he’s owned cats before and knows what he’s doing and we got into a huge argument. 
i have half a mind to just stay home with her even though i really want to see my mom and brother because i won’t get to see them again until thanksgiving

I have 3 dogs, am work from home as an International Specialist and we live on the third floor of a building with no elevator. My job means I work from 8pm - 4am  but am on call nearly all day.

It’s been a massive heatwave and with my schedule means the onlu time I’m “off” is during the hottest part of the day. My dogs and I have not left the house in about 3 weeks. At first I was worried about them but I noticed all the other tenants were letting the dogs go to the bathroom on the balconies. It worked for us. 

My upstairs neighbor is complaining about the “smell,” my downstairs neighbor says that “urine and fecal matter” are “leaking” through the concrete deck (yeah right). I have a meeting with my apartment manager on Monday and have not found any specific prohibition against what I am doing. I am asking here to get more of a “moral” perspective.

AITA?

Basically my mother came into my room without a reason, she was enraged to see me in my bed and held just seconds ago a lecture how me sleeping will make me achieve nothing in life, as if I didn't hear that too many times already.

She also got mad that I am doing nothing while my younger sister is washing her OWN laundry. And it's not even much. She simply put her blanket and pillow into the washing machine- 

Plus, there is nothing to do. The house is clean, all vacuumed, laundry mostly done and I already took out the trash. The rest I did yesterday...

So AITA for having a nap in the day?

AITA for Manipulating my Friend while he was High,3,156o1e0,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156o1e0/aita_for_manipulating_my_friend_while_he_was_high/,33,"I (M25) was out celebrating the birthday my friend (M21), who we will call Nick, and our friend, Martha (F43), a good friend of ours.

We had taken Nick to a local bar as it was his 21st, and we figured a trial by fire would be best. By the time we had neared the end of our drinking, Martha pulled out a bag of blunts.

Nick had been talking about wanting to try smoking for a while, and Martha and I arranged it as his 21st present. Though, I will say this was where we may have fucked up, since I know it can mess with people when you mix them together. But, none of us were sober, and so we all went into the disabled bathroom together.

Not too long into smoking, Martha and I notice Nick starting to behave really out of character from what we were expecting. He seemed to green out for a moment before suddenly coming to, and started freaking out. He was asking us where he was, and who we were, and when we tried to explain that he was in a bathroom, he seemed confused at what a 'bathroom' was?

Obviously, Martha and I had no idea what to do, so we started panicking. My memory is really spotty, but Martha responds to Nicks frantic ""Who ARE you?"" with, regrettably, a Yo Mama joke. Nick latches onto this, fully believing Martha is actually his mother. Not wanting to upset Nick more by confusing him, I go along with it, and tell him I'm his father. 

This goes on for a while, as we guide him out of the bar, back to his apartment. He seemed confused and scared. He barely understands that the place we're taking him to is his house by this point, and seems to be upset that he doesn't even remember his 'parents'.

Martha and I decide it would be best to leave him alone for the night, and after a short argument we both left and went back to our respective homes

&#x200B;

I wake up to Martha calling me, which I answer. She's frantic, asking me if Nick's friends have told me anything. She says his friend's have been harassing her all morning, saying that Nick has told them ""what you two did last night"".

I'm confused for a moment, barely remembering the events of last night, until I'm reminded by her yelling down the line at me,

""They're saying we really fucked up by telling him we were his parents. I don't even know how they found it out.""

My call is interrupted by an incoming call from Nick, which I answer quickly.

Instantly he's upset, saying we convinced him of some 'weird shit' while he was out of it. I'm on the defense immediately, saying we did our best to keep him safe. He yells at me for 'convincing him that I was his father', which I understand why it would upset him. But, still, Martha and I thought it was best for him. I hang up once he starts screaming

He floods my text for the rest of the day, and I'm starting to doubt that we really made the best decision at the time.

AITA?

TLDR; my friend and I try and help our friend who was high by letting him believe we were his parents. he called the next morning furious, saying we were out of line for what we did. ",1690042056.0
AITA For asking my sister a question?,3,156o0on,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156o0on/aita_for_asking_my_sister_a_question/,5,"Names changed. 


I (Lily 34) told my sister Tabitha (30) that I started writing a book about the past.   Most of it is my past but I thought maybe she would want me to mention some of the things she went through.  She immediately told me she had to go and that she would call me back.   I waited several days but didn't hear from her so I tried calling~no answer, text~no reply.  The radio silence went on for weeks.

I waited a few more weeks and tried calling her.  She answered this time but claimed to be busy.  I told her I just had a few questions about some things I don't remember from our childhood along with some other questions.  She told me to email her the questions, so I did. 

I spent some time writing up the email and sent her a text letting her know I had sent it. She told me that she didn't want me to write anything about her.   I said that's why I asked.  Then she got angry and said I am dumb for even asking and went on a rant directed at me.

After that… nothing.  Months go by and no word from her, no calls, no texts, nono online messages, nothing.  Sometime in December she facetime calls my husband (which she has never done before EVER).  I was irritated that she didn't called him and not me, so I ducked behind the couch.  Not one of my finest moments but I didn't want to be on camera. 

After a few days she posted a status herher Social Media saying you have to let go of people but in a much meaner way. 

Not being 100% posative this was referring to me, I posted a meme on mine.
 
I saw that she had started replying to all of the supportive comments on her status and she made it clear that it was definitely about me without saying it or defend myself. 

She restricted my access so I couldn't comment.  So I posted on my account ~ It doesn't prove anything when you publicly attack someone on Social Media and then restrict their access so they can't defend themselves.  She attacked me in the comments.  Called me names, etc.  Even told me that our mom said I was wrong. 

I said:  After they all heard your side of the story, how perfect! 

Tabitha proceeds to post all of the screenshots of our text messages which do include those specific details she didn't want to be known.  But not the email ~ the email where I had literally asked her what her PREFERENCE was. 

She then blocked me on Facebook.

My aunt let her stay at her other house as she just left an abusive relationship and this has been irritating him. It’s her place that was left to her. He has recently been more vocal about it. 

She recently confided in me that it makes her happy to be able to help her out and that she wishes the family members would stop stressing her out about it all the time. The thing is that the rest of us are fine and I know that she would help us out if we were in that situation. It’s just stressing her out and she wants them to stop.

His irritation has been stronger lately and it was obvious at the last holiday event. I have just noticed that he makes a point to leave my sister out lately and it has become obvious at this recent event as he said that she is not welcome and putting his foot down and won’t budge. My sister doesn’t know as my aunt does not want her to know. She casually mention the event to my sister but she didn’t talk about it to her after finding out she wasn’t invited. He mention this yesterday, the day before. I just am afraid that she will see if they post photos on social media.

I am his favorite family member and I feel like I could say something but am afraid. I do not want to participate in leaving people out. Our family is small as we lost a lot of people since Covid it just makes me sad that we are divided on this.

AITA for giving another man my song to finish instead of my boyfriend ?,3,156pxsv,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156pxsv/aita_for_giving_another_man_my_song_to_finish/,4,"So, I might be the one who is mistaken, but I genuinely want to understand why. I create my own songs, producing and singing them myself. After finishing a song, there are two essential steps to be done: mixing and mastering. My boyfriend has been kind enough to teach me music over the past 2 years. Unfortunately, making music with him has always been emotionally stressful because he often ends up insulting me in some way.

Recently, we collaborated on a song for a job that I secured for him. During that process, he got angry at me for asking a lot of questions, but he didn't express this until days later when I asked him why he was being hurtful that evening.

A couple of weeks ago, I finished a song entirely on my own. I informed him that I planned to have another producer mix my song, as he has been unable to do so for me many times before, citing financial constraints. Besides, I lack the necessary skills for that task. Strangely, as soon as I mentioned getting help from someone else, he immediately offered to assist and did half of the work.

The issue now is that I had already approached the other producer, who was excited to help me (not for free), and I had informed him about it. My boyfriend is now extremely angry, accusing me of humiliating him by expressing a preference for someone else to mix my song. He claims that I've discarded his efforts as if they were worthless.

I tried explaining to him that I need to be more independent and have my own resources for situations when he cannot offer things for free. It's not a matter of devaluing his work; it's about ensuring I can get things done even when he's unable to assist.",1690046671.0

Our friend group has a clan ingame, and we do a lot together (raids, dungeons, etc). It’s a casual group and they tend to take things easy. They do admittedly go a little slower than I would like, but they’re all content with it so I go along with it just fine. 

Several years back, we were in a different clan with different people. The guys in that group are much more active in the game, and their play styles are entirely different to what our group does now. Due to some rather explosive disagreements between them and my girlfriend (we weren’t together yet at the time), she no longer associates with them, and refuses to play the game with people outside of our circle.

Recently, a few of the guys from that old group have gotten back into the game, and they’ve been playing hard like they used to. One in particular, who I’ll call M (22M), REALLY does not like my girlfriend, and she hates him. The way he does things is much more my speed, though, and so I go with him fairly often to do one thing or another in the game.

Whenever I finish running dungeons with M and come back to the voice chat with my girlfriend and clanmates, though, GF in particular always seems a bit… sullen? She gets very quiet and doesn’t really want to talk about it. I’ve asked her a couple of times if she can tell me what part of it upsets her, and she’s said that she’s just paranoid that I’m going to abandon our clan and go back to those guys.

Now there was alot of drama going on with everyone one in particular was the prank war going on in the boys dorm. It all started when (B 16 M) stole the clothes from the shower of (A 16 M) and A held a grudge because of this and all the boys cornered him and pantsed B 15 times ( pulled his pants down). Upon hearing this we all laughed but I had some worry in my mind.  
  
Now B is a very overwhelming and hard to deal with person and often brings up politics alot him being a very conservative person but I have a had some decent conversations with him and consider him a friend as we enjoy alot of the same shows and games like Avatar, Attack on Titan, Halo, etc. He gets picked on alot by people because of this.  
  
I do sometimes roast him but all in good fun he does the same thing to me but I make sure never to cross any bounderies.

I woke up and went to check on B to see if he was okay he said he was and that the guys didnt do it and that they wouldnt do anything like it. At the end of the day I confronted A and the boys and they said they were going to do it but the counsellers stopped them. I said how stupid it was and that it was fine to joke around but that was too far. He just said it wasnt a big deal and I needed to get over it.  
  
I then said if his daughter or son had come to him upset because he or she was ducktaped and ziptied to a bed would it be funny and he said yes. All the guys were just passing me up and saying I was being ridiculous.

We met and had our first child a few months before I commissioned into the ARMY. I’ve made a very promising start to my career impressing a good number of higher ups. However, as a result I haven’t been around my family that often. My current unit is extremely toxic and would rather me run myself and soldiers into the ground then allow me to give them a well deserved break before our deployment in a few weeks. I’ve been given the majority of additional duties in my company and find that I have little time for leading my PLT. When I am able to come home and spend time with my family I like to relax and let my mind free of all the worries. 

My wife on the other hand sees my time home as an opportunity to go on adventures and spend money. Which we do not have, seeing as I am the only provider and we just spent 16 days on vacation visiting family. My wife told me that I often walk around looking melancholy, bland, and someone who doesn’t want to do anything with life. I certainly don’t feel that way, but I do think I have lost a vigor I once had with life. 

We are expecting our next child while I am deployed. I am excited, but my unit is making it extremely difficult on weather or not I will be able to come back for her delivery. I’ve shared my concerns with my wife about everything, but she’s just gotten defensive.  Saying that I have to be there because I’m her husband but I know I do not have a choice in the matter until I can get the approval from my BN. 

I feel that I am being pulled in a million directions with my work. I come home to a family that sees me exhausted to the point I can barely eat. My wife’s support always comes down to “you’ll figure it out.” I’m treated as if I’m a ghost in my own house. Which make me very frustrated. 

Their is constant work needing to be done around the house, cooking, cleaning, going to the store, repairs. My wife helps with our son by picking him up and dropping him off at daycare, occasionally cooks, rarely cleans and always wants to go somewhere in the country to visit friends and family. While I handle the rest. 

I’m getting to the point we’re my mind is starting to have very bad thoughts. I feel like a failure, to my family and to my country. I feel like I’m struggling to keep up with the demands of my life and receive little to no help when I try to improve?

I (NB26) live with my mom and stepdad (both 50s) because I’m disabled and not able to live on my own.  I have autism and anxiety, so I admit that I can be sensitive, but I’m trying to work on that. 

I’m legally blind, so sudden and loud noises scare me and make me feel vulnerable.  I have explained this to my stepdad, but he still thinks it’s funny to sneak up behind me and make loud noises to spook me.  The last time he did this, a few days ago, I was already stressed, so I admittedly snapped at him a bit.  I told him that I didn’t think his “joke” was funny, that I had told him why I didn’t like it, and asked him not to do it to me multiple times, and he ignored it.

My stepdad started complaining that he was “just joking” and that I take things too seriously.  He supposedly does the same thing to my mom all the time (I haven’t seen it), and she (again, supposedly) doesn’t mind, so why am I making a big deal out of it?

At this point, my mom joined in and told me that if she puts up with it, I should just get used to it and stop complaining.  I lost my temper a bit, and told her that just because she puts up with something doesn’t mean I have to.

The dog is also one of those annoying little yappy breeds with a high pitched bark. Throughout the relationship she has always called the dog her ""baby"" and she tells me how perfect she thinks the dog is.

For context I also have a dog who I love very much, he's pretty old and he sleeps on a mat in my room. I trained him as a puppy and he's extremely independent. He will take himself out his dog door when he needs to go to the toilet and he's fine being left at my house alone when I go to work, or stay a night at my girlfriends place. He doesn't bark and he knows where he stands in relation to me.

In contrast, my gf sleeps with her dog every night in the bed, it is always in the room with us, even when we have sex, it will growl at me when I get close to her, and it yelps periodically throughout the night for her to let it out into the backyard to use the toilet which wakes me up too. It also has a bad habit of pooing or pissing on the floor of her ensuite, and at night I have stepped in it's crap when using the bathroom. My gf also refuses to sleep over at my place ever because the dog has supposed separation anxiety.

I explained to her that anytime she does this she's actually just reinforcing the dogs terrible behaviours and this really pissed her off. She called me an AH and said her dog doesn't have bad behaviours.

AITA For Refusing to Share a Campsite With Strangers?,7141,1557xjh,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1557xjh/aita_for_refusing_to_share_a_campsite_with/,1290,"Last weekend, my wife (30F) and I (30M) went on a backpacking hike in the PNW.  The hike was 24 miles total (12 in & 12 out), with the trail ending at a beautiful crystal blue lake. The trailhead was close to 3 hours from our home, so we woke up at 3:30 am to be sure we’d get an early start. For those unfamiliar with overnight backpacking, the end of a hike typically has several established flat sites to pitch a tent; they are always first come first served and not reservable or numbered in any way. 

My wife and I started the hike around 7:00 am and finished at 1:30 pm. We were surprised to find that we were the first ones to complete the hike, but more surprised to find that there were only 4 sites scattered around the lake. For a hike this long, it’s not uncommon to find 8 or 9 sites at the end. Regardless, we were glad we had options and chose the first spot that sat directly in front of the lake. We wondered what might happen as other people started to trickle in. 

Lo and behold, within the next hour a few other groups showed up and the remaining sites were claimed. Around 4pm, a group of 4 hikers arrived at the lake. At this point, my wife and I had been well established at our site, with our tent, cooking gear, and supplies spread out. The group of 4 hiked around the lake searching for spots and eventually returned to our site. They stood around for a few minutes before approaching us and asking if we could move our tent to share the space with them. Given the size of our site, their tents would have been no more than 6 feet from ours, and our otherwise private backpacking trip would have become a shared experience with strangers. We would have been cooking food together, gathering water together, and hearing each others conversations. Therefore, we politely declined, and suggested they check for sites at the lower lake about a mile and a half back. They were clearly displeased by our answer, and gave us the “C’mon man,” routine. We again declined to share the site, at which point they became upset and insisted that we move our tent to make room for both of theirs.  They said it “wasn’t fair” that we were capitalizing on the spot. We maintained our position and they ultimately left the lake.

My wife’s and my backpacking philosophy has always been to set ourselves up for success by arriving early. The whole point of backpacking for us is to get away from social obligations and be in solitude. Are we the assholes?

Update: I wanted to address a few things based on the comments. First, the hike was to Lake Dorothy in Snoqualmie WA for those inquiring. In addition, I failed to mentioned we also had our dog with us. Although she is very sweet and friendly, it was another element that deterred us from wanting to be around a large group. Lastly, we didn’t have any concerns about being murdered (until after reading some of your scenarios!). Our biggest concern was the size of the group and their rather assertive request to have us move. Had it been one or two hikers with a different temperament, it may have been different.",1689898303.0

She said some incredibly awful and hurtful things and accused me of basically abusing my parents. I have stayed living in the family home and am the sibling who looks after my parents as they are getting older. While she does nothing for them, yet still expects them to travel to her and mind her 2 young kids if she has weddings etc to go to. 

Jen, who also moved back to the family home recently had a baby. Sara is planning on visiting next week with her 2 kids. My mam said this in front of my daughter(10) and saying how Sara is hoping she'll be there when she visits. Now I have made it very clear previously to my mam that I will not be around whenever Sara visits and if needed will arrange to stay in a hotel if she's here. 
My mam knew what she was doing, saying what she did to my daughter as now she is all excited to see her cousins.

AITA for creating an ‘us’ or ‘them’ situation?,1,156y7yu,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156y7yu/aita_for_creating_an_us_or_them_situation/,3,"I (16F) was a part of a friend group consisting of 6 girls, all of similar ages (D,B,K,L and N). Up to the event I was never great friends with L. 

She made me uncomfortable many times by touching me and getting extremely close. I had told her many times to stop but she didn’t. I created distance between us and ensured I was never left alone with her. N and L became extremely distant from the group. They would walk off without us during breaks and ignoring us. It sounds selfish but I got used to them not being there a lot and started to feel more comfortable within the friend group.

L had become increasingly interested in my sexuality. I’ve never really labelled myself but L would make comments about me being a lesbian and would call me a ‘good little lesbian’, and I yet again voiced for her to stop especially since, from what she knew, I was straight. 

I kept all my concerns and comments to myself in fear of splitting the friend group until B and I were on the bus alone we start talking and end up agreeing on a lot of things to do with L. I was just saying how she’d done something that day that had made me feel uncomfortable and B started talking about her own experiences which were scarily similar. 

L and N had started hanging out more with a girl in our year (let’s call her M).I knew she was in a few of my classes. D and I started talking one day and I found out why we were avoiding L and N whilst they hung out with M. Before we were a friend group M did the same thing to D that L was doing to us. She had harassed D many a time and inappropriately touched her continuously including on her ass. She had also made bundles of comments that were of poor taste to say the least. The harassment was way worse than L had ever done to us and I felt so bad for her. I felt disgusted that D had confided in L and N about this and yet they chose to associate themselves with M. 

That was all I needed to cut ties with both of them. I set harder boundaries and anytime L moved too close to me I would physically get up and leave, on the bus I would purposely sit farther back so that I could avoid her. This was probably shitty on my part but I really did feel disgusted with them and their behaviour.

 She still kept hanging with our group but would do small things to annoy us and I felt like it was consciously, she would do small things to get under your skin and when we got to the point where all of us were extremely irritated, she would go back to normal so it made our anger seem misdirected. 

At this point, all of us are fed up and quite frankly slightly disgusted with some of their actions that I couldn’t include in this. I hate to make it an ‘us’ or ‘her’ situation but D rightfully refuses to be anywhere near M and I am more than happy to avoid her. 

I hate that this has happened and I feel partially at fault for it but I really need to know if I’m being the asshole here.",1690067255.0

She’s an ugly, obese bitch that makes fun of him to try to get everyone to laugh, even around the rest of our friend group (we never laugh). It’s not just jokingly teasing like a lot of couples do, it’s always too mean-spirited, and he never does it back (she’d definitely flip if he did too). She’s also super controlling like when we were at his college graduation party and he asked how our other friend was doing. His girlfriend got pissy and started getting all mad at him about how “she doesn’t want her brought up because today is supposed to be a happy day” even though it’s HIS day.

Long story short, all of us hate her. Me and our friend who I workout with have a plan to try to get him to start going since he’s shown interest before (asking us about stuff like if we take any supplements and whatnot), so we think once he’s over the initial hurdle of getting it into a routine and seeing some progress, he’ll keep going. We’re hoping that if we did that, he’d get more attention from other girls and he’d realize he has options besides Gorlock the Destroyer. Since he’s not visually appalling and his main issue is that he’s EXTREMELY skinny

He was always very paranoid about my mother, and would go to extreme measures to bash her and tell us she's insane. 
My father and his new wife decided that moving to a different state would be the best option for their well being. At the time, i was only 13, so i could not go with them because I was still in school. While they were moving out, i lived with my mom primarily. My dad texted me one afternoon while i was at my moms if it would be a good time to drop off some of my stuff from his house. I said yes, and that he could just pull up to the side of the road so he didn't have to pull into the driveway. My mom was home, but i asked for permission for this to happen and she agreed, not seeing a problem with it. I did not tell my dad my mother was home because i didn't think that was important. 
Once my dad arrived, i walked outside to go get my things from his car. My mother walks out behind me but only stays on the deck just to see what i was getting. As i approach the car, my father gives me a dirty look and yells at me for not telling him my mom was gonna be home. i look surprised and tell him i didn't think it was that big of a deal. he hands me my stuff and drives off. Later that afternoon he facetimes me and tells me i betrayed him by not telling him she was there, and tries to convince me that my mom was screaming and recording him when i know for a fact she was just standing on the deck watching. I told him he was overreacting and none of that happened. He called me a liar and essential told me to ""reflect"".

my best friend (who i’ll refer to as “B”) has recently been making me feel like she isn’t a good person to be friends with. she was at the movies with a group of guys. she told me that one of the guys called her fine but he has a girlfriend. later she talked about a guy who wanted to cuddle during the movies but i was unaware it was a different guy. i confronted her asking why she would cuddle with him if he had a girlfriend, when she told me she doesn’t care if he had a girlfriend or not and doesn’t care if he’s being disloyal since it’s not her problem.

i told her it made me feel like i didn’t want to bring guys around her again. (her ex and the last guy she talked to i introduced her to). she told me that she wouldn’t help a future boyfriend of mine cheat with her because we’re best friends.

i am going on a family vacation tomorrow after going on a trip with my grandpa which i am currently coming back from. when i told B i was packing, she asked me what for and i told her. she responded with “im gonna cry who am i gonna hang out with next week”. i told her that she hasn’t hung out with me all july and she could hang out with her other friend (“M” and B have been hanging out almost every day)

She immediately gave me 3 different excuses and told me M was also going on vacation . i know that i can also ask to hang out but i have asked her twice, canceled plans, and have been as flexible as i can. the only time she has asked if she could hang was “can M and i come over and swim”. i like M and think shes nice, but i wanted to have fun and not third wheel. she told me i was selfish when i said no (i didn’t have a reason) and asked if she could have the key to the pool cover so her and M could swim. 

my final straw was yesterday when i made a joke about my “fans” and that “people are obsessing” over me because people who i don’t talk to anymore still view my stories on instagram. i know that they are just viewing a story and don’t care that i posted but i was just trying to make a joke. B responded with “why would they be your fans. they don’t like you, i think they’re just viewing stories”. 

i told her that she didn’t have to be a “rude bitch” and that “they are my fans”. i thought this was funny but she turned around and told me i’m being rude. i didn’t feel like telling her i’ve been annoyed with her so i sent a nerd emoji. i’ve been on opened for 17 hours on snap. aita??

In my time knowing her, she has shown an intense interest in a niche music genre, and it has been something she has bonded with me over and integrated me heavily into. We pursued a relationship with one another in that time, and were together for almost half a year before we broke up due to complications in our relationship.  


After making up with one another, we became close friends once again, and over the course of that time I discovered that she was talking to another girl, 17F. She produced music in the niche genre that my friend enjoyed, and after a few months of talking they fell in love with one another and decided to enter a relationship of their own.  


To my knowledge, things were at least fairly healthy with the two of them, so I didn't question much aside from asking how they were doing on occasion. Later on, after a call that stretched extremely late into the evening, she confessed that she had told her current girlfriend that she's a year older than she actually was out of fear that they wouldn't be able to pursue a relationship. Reasonably, I was disappointed and expressed to her in-depth why that was the wrong decision, and she agreed with me, but still passively made attempts to defend herself and explain why, while wrong, and that she did deserve every bit of scrutiny, she couldn't tell her girlfriend that she was actually 15.  


This stretched on into the next day, before she explained that she wouldn't/couldn't tell her significant other that she was a year younger. I expressed to her that her excuses were extremely stupid, and did so quite bluntly. We talked on for another half an hour or so about how their relationship wasn't necessarily healthy, until I threatened to message her girlfriend explaining the situation.  
As a result of this, they had a discussion the next morning about their age gap, and, while still actively in a relationship, her girlfriend has significantly dipped in communication and online activity since.

WIBTA if I asked my boyfriend to come help me at my job on his day off?,0,156xwt6,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156xwt6/wibta_if_i_asked_my_boyfriend_to_come_help_me_at/,11,"TLDR: I work long hours at my own business and a second job to make an international trip for him and long-term financial goals reachable for us while he gets off work early afternoon and chills at home.

&#x200B;

I (30f) and my boyfriend (35m) have been together for about 4 years. I'm a small business owner and he works for one of my vendors- it's how we met. As many might assume, small business ownership is really hard- I knew this when I bought the company and I do not regret it one bit. The pandemic changed the way a lot of retail businesses function, and it made a huge impact on our industry and my shop.

Over the last few years I've been really careful to not drag my boyfriend into working in my shop for free. Once in a blue moon I ask for a hand for an afternoon and occasionally have paid him for his time. From my perspective, his job is very chill- for the most part he's home by 2 or 3 in the afternoon. He works full time, but it's hourly pay and not that great. He doesn't have any degrees and has no desire to change jobs- he feels like that for his skillset this is the best it'll get. On the other hand, I often work late into the night and sometimes through the night pushing to grow my company and make things better for our future.

I do a large portion of the household work or it just doesn't get done- meal prep, laundry (he'll start a load but dump it on the couch instead of folding it. We have a dog that likes to lay on it and I end up having to rewash it because we live in the country and she loves cow shit), etc.

He brought up jokingly that it would be really cool to get to go on this specific international vacation. International travel is typically just beyond our means. I asked if he really wanted to go and said if he did- we'd make it happen. He didn't see it as being possible but I knew that with budgeting and a little extra work we (I) could make it happen. 

I took on a second job several months ago. I've been juggling schedules and having to leave the shop to do a shift elsewhere 4 days a week then coming back and working into the night to make sure everything is done. I paid for the flights in full, passports, and luggage. He plans to contribute to activities, food and hotel, but has yet to do so.

Fast forward to now- I'm making some changes in the way my business operates and moving locations to lower my overhead and increase my take-home pay. The shop is a wreck despite us being open through the transition. I'm now short staffed, behind on a lot of tasks at work, & still juggling the second job. Meanwhile, he's done nothing to create extra income to make this trip a reality or to help alleviate some of my workload while I earn the funds.  


I want to ask him to come help out at the shop on his day off and make a list of household chores that he often forgets. WIBTA?",1690066465.0
AITA for not wanting my bf to go to another girls house for a party,0,156xuvk,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156xuvk/aita_for_not_wanting_my_bf_to_go_to_another_girls/,30,"BEFORE YOU READ: I would never/have not said he cannot go. I want him to go but i’m feeling apprehensive about it. I’m debating wether or not to bring up how i’m feeling with him or just pretend i’m totally fine. I’m sorry if title is misleading, as certain people seem to think I’m stopping him from going. 


So my (18F) boyfriend (18M) is insisting to go to a girls house for a party this weekend saying that he hasn’t seen his (guy) friends in a setting like this in a long time, which is true it has been a while. However he sees his friends at football 3x a week. 

However, before we started going out to parties at around 16 we agreed on one rule and it’s that we can’t go to the other genders house without the other. It’s just a boundary thing we BOTH agreed on prior to starting to party. 

I am not invited to this party, and he does not want to ask if I can go nor do I want him to ask, i think if I was invited, I would’ve been told. Some of his friends that go bring their girlfriends who also bring their friend group, however some don’t and these parties are synonymous with being a hookup night. But it’s pretty standard for people to go as ‘couples’ and it’s also pretty crowded. I am also hurt at not being invited as it does feel intentional to not have me there when I am quite friendly with the majority of girls I know are going. There are also a few girls who are going who he has liked in the past but nothing has ever happened between him and anyone else. I’m his first girlfriend. 

It’s only across the road from where he lives and he swears down he wouldn’t drink so that “nothing happens”. He also promises to be home before midnight. So I’m not concerned for his safety considering the proximity to where he lives but I think it’s the principle of the situation. 

To me, we have one rule and him not being able to abide by that is pretty poor and shows the level of respect he has for me and our relationship. We’ve been together for nearly 4 years too and have a holiday booked for next year. 

However, this is only the 2nd time he’s been invited and these have being going on for a long time. I know he’s felt left out in the past and I really don’t want to keep him from his friends, but this just seems disrespectful. He has said he wouldn’t want me to go if it were me asking him. I do understand why he wants to go and know I can’t physically stop him nor do i want to. 
 

So, AITA for being uncomfortable and not wanting him to go?


EDIT: for some clarification on why the boundary is in place: When I was around 15, I went to a party with some girl friends and a few guys were there. My bf felt uncomfortable with this since he wasn’t there and we decided this boundary was fair as it added extra security when partying without eachother but also allowed us to have time with our own friends.

EDIT: Thank you to anyone who’s gave insights because i am honestly feeling better now. Think i needed to be brought to reality a little. I’m very appreciative of anything being said.",1690066327.0

&#x200B;

I am type 1 diabetic and need to see an endocrinologist for that, when I arrived I found an excellent one and have seen her three times before this one since then. 

Anyways about 1 month ago I was day drinking and got way too drunk and passed out sleeping and with my insulin pump falling off at the same time, after a while of sleeping the people I were with saw me hyperventilating, woke me up and called 911, I was brought to the ER with DKA where they stabilized me and brought me to the ICU where they lowered the BS over the night, after that night I was brought for 1 day and in the ICU and 2 days in the general ward. 

The same night I arrived at the ER my endocrinologist showed up in very nice clothes (looks like she was going to a party or maybe was at one) to talk about me with the ER docs, I apologized for my drunkenness ruining her night out and she commented in jest that she was planning to get a little tipsy herself on nice wine before the ER called. She visited me the two days in the general ward as well and I also got two nurses who treated me the most in the ICU and the ward who I also gave a gift. 

Now after this stay the bill came a little over 20k, since I have great insurance I didn't have to pay any additional copay since I already reached the limit before going to the hospital. So I just thought I'd spend 15% on gifts in the same way you would a tip (where I'm from the word for gift can be used interchangeably as tip). Anyways I got $500 in amazon gift cards for both the nurses and since I had a bit more personal story to base it on for the doctor I went to a kosher wine shop and asked them to put together a case from Bordeaux for 2k as a gift. 

So when I went to the doctor for follow up I found both the nurses and they politely refused saying they weren't allowed to take cash or gift cards, one said a much smaller gift of chocolate or something could've been accepted. 

When I brought the case and a thank you card to the doctor she was just outright offended and seemingly angry and told me it was incredibly inappropriate and rude as well, now I just accepted the complaint since I didn't want to quarrel about what is rude or not with the doctor, but I sort of think she overreacted and am wondering if I should change doctors. At least I'm going to bring chocolates for the nurses, but I'm unsure if I should do anything for the doctor. Anyways am I the asshole here or should she have accepted my gift?",1690066164.0
AITAH for not raking my leaves?,2,156sbbx,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156sbbx/aitah_for_not_raking_my_leaves/,16,"I (28m) purchased a condo about a year ago. The layout of the building is important so I'll try my best to explain. The building is three stories and has external stairs with a shared front wooden balcony/porch on each floor, kind of like a motel. So you can walk the length of the front porch walking past other people's doors, and you are also able to put patio furniture, etc, on the portion of the porch in front of your unit. I am on the third floor, and there are a lot of trees in front of the building, so in the fall a good amount of leaves are on the front porch area. The leaves didn't bother me at all, so I didn't do anything to sweep up the ones in front of my unit. I rarely (never) spend time on the porch area, and I don't have any furniture out there.

On the other hand, my next-door neighbors are out there all the time. They have some nice patio furniture and generally will sit outside whenever it is warm. They are really nice neighbors. I think I am a respectful neighbor as well and they seem to like me. One day in the fall I noticed all the leaves in front of my unit were gone. A couple of weeks later, my neighbor mentioned her husband swept up my leaves. She didn't really seem annoyed or upset, she just kind of mentioned it casually. I do think she mentioned it because they wanted me to do it going forward though. I said thank you and initially felt pretty bad about it. The condo rules don't explicitly say anything about leaves, but it mentions ""maintaining neat and presentable limited common areas under our designated use"" which would apply to the front porch area. 

I don't consider myself a lazy person, the interior of my condo is generally clean. I just don't care about the front porch area at all so I didn't bother cleaning up the leaves. I definitely don't think my neighbors are the AH for sweeping the leaves in front of my unit for me. But I am wondering if I should make the effort this fall and sweep the leaves myself.

My sister(16F), instead of going together, always tells me to bring something for her, be it from a restaurant or a shop. At first I complied, however, over time it started to get anoying. I either have to walk around twice as much and waste tons of time finding what she asked for or go to other restaurants and wait for her food. And just to be clear, it's not that I can't do that for her, I just cant stand the fact that she is not occupied and could go with me and get what she wants. 

So at one point I started going and not bringing anything back if I see that she could have gone as well and is just being lazy and entitled. AITA for this? Should I have acted differently? Because my parents are giving me a lot of shit for being like this, while I myself am just doing this out of principle.

By the way, my relationship with my sister is not terrible, but we're not friends either.

EDIT: So from some of the comments I can see that I didn't explain crearly enough and missed some details. First of all, I am not complaining about gas money, since the car is my parents'. That is also why I feel like I could be the asshole and a bit guilty. The main reason I stopped being a delivery driver is mentioned before the edit, but another small reason is that she does this with my parents as well and they still listen, this anoyed me as well. What irks me the most is that she does not seem to appretiate the time my parents and I spend doing this. At first I thought that these details are not very important, but from the comments I can see that this may change some people's judgement, so I'm adding them in.",1690025260.0

She was incredibly intrigued by my frogs and begged me to hold one of them. I told her I couldn't allow her to because as some of you may or may not know, frogs have very sensitive skin and can absorb things through it meaning oils, perfumes, etc. I told her this and she got extremely upset, going as far as stepping outside of my house and calling an Uber for herself without speaking one word to me.

AITA for saying we can’t look after my boyfriends siblings?,384,155pp3o,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155pp3o/aita_for_saying_we_cant_look_after_my_boyfriends/,73,"My boyfriend and I have been together for three years, and live together in a good sized flat and have a spare room and an office room we can use as a spare room. 

When we were first together it was during covid and when restrictions lifted we both were more than happy to have his younger siblings stay (now agreed 7&9). Over time this has turned into them being dropped off to stay for a night, turning into two nights at short notice and being asked to ‘babysit’ A LOT. My boyfriend and I are both in our mid twenties, and have busy social lives and work full time we usually aren’t free unless it’s planned. 

Last week after them being left with us the entire weekend, resulting in us cancelling plans we agreed that he needed to speak to his Mum about it. 

For reference his Mum has just gone through a bad breakup, and doesn’t have a lot of extra help / child care.

The conversation with his Mum apparently went well. 

My boyfriend cannot access his phone at work for security reasons and this morning I received a message from his Mum asking if we will have the kids ‘just for the night’ - as she hasn’t had any time this week. She’s also thrown in the fact she was a single Mum and raised my boyfriend and his brother on her own, which I feel is a guilt trip. 

AITA for replying ‘Sorry we can’t do this weekend as we have plans’ even though we do not have any firm plans this evening.",1689949921.0
AITA for not wanting to stay any longer in a cult even for my wife?,15,156e5dj,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156e5dj/aita_for_not_wanting_to_stay_any_longer_in_a_cult/,21,"My parents, grandparents and big part of my family are trapped in this cult. I married in this cult believing that we were the only true God's people in the world that would survive the genocide of the entire world. My wife and his whole family are trapped in this cult. 
This year in January I realized that all my life was revolved in a lie. If God is love, how could he wipe all the mankind and save 0,01% just because we interpreted the bible differently of everybody?  I would give my life to save my colleagues of work, even the people on the same market, so how could God be less good than I? 

Anyway, so I talked kindly with my wife in May that I don't believe anymore that we are special people. I tried to reasoning with her, but she broke up, cried a lot and was a tough day. I promised to keep going to the cult to support her, and she calmed down. I have since started therapy because I was having panic attacks listening the BS at the cult. 
My wife is very saddened because I don't like to do the cultish things the same way as I did in the past years of our marriage. Note: I started doing more good things toward her, and her family, I always liked to help in our home, and now I do more good things, even encouraging her to do the things that she likes in that group, but to her it's not the same, she would prefer that I don't help in the mundane things, but be active in this high control group. 
In June she saw some notes that I wrote disagreeing with the cult, and the hell broke down again, and I again decided to stop criticizing and staying obedient, because I love her so much, and I Know it's a tough situation to her too.
But this cult is consuming myself, I'm not the same person, I am anxious all the time thinking about losing my family and my wife, and everyday I hear the importance of ***OBEY THE LEADERS, THE WORLD WILL BE SOON DESTROYED, STAY WITH THE MEMBERS, SHUN THE EVIL PEOPLE***
and I have decided to stop everything next month. Stop attending the meetings, stop indoctrinating others Door to door, stop everything. I've received some advices in a subreddit about having Patience and with time I can get my wife out of this situation, but I feel that I can't stand this anymore, and I know that this could end our marriage, even if I love her and know that this could hurt her a lot.

So, 
1. AITA for not wanting to keep this going on for years, and rather trying my best to be a good person and not give my life and energy to a sect? 
2. Sometimes I think that I'm the worst husband of the world, because I have a truly amazing wife, but I don't want to stay in this situation, and when I see that some spouses stayed his whole life in a cult even knowing that everything was a BS, but they stayed for the spouse, that makes me feel worse than everyone. 

Any advices? Thanks in advance.",1690013646.0

I would be staying elsewhere too if it weren't for our dog, who also gets scared and needs someone to hide and cuddle with when my brother is around. He has been in town for about a week and it has not been comfortable at all. Yesterday, my mom and brother left to visit out of state family for the weekend and are coming back on Monday meaning Im home alone for the weekend. 

I invited my grandparents and sister over for dinner last night so we could talk, my sister could grab anything else she needs, and hang out with the dog who she really loves. I was hoping after this I could have a chill weekend to myself for the first time in a very long time. 

While I was showering, my sister texted me that they were coming over to take the dog for a while. I didn't see the text until after I was done showering, so I called her, but she just wanted to argue, not listen. Then my Grandma called, and asked me if it was okay, saying she didn't want my sister coming over if I didn't want it, I told her I really wanted to be alone. I said they should come by Monday morning when it is cooler outside before my mom and brother get back. My sister was upset, but my Grandma fully understood.

AITA for wanting to spilt a bill this way?,3,156oq7k,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156oq7k/aita_for_wanting_to_spilt_a_bill_this_way/,12,"so, every year my family goes on a camping trip. my two sisters go up with their husbands and children in RVs, while I, the single childless one, go up in a tent. my parents and grandma also go up - they are also in RVs.

for the trip, we get four campsites - one for each RV (sister, sister, parents, grandma). Rather than getting my own site, there's space enough amongst the four we have for me to pitch my tent and park my car.

a couple of years ago, one sister suggested that the three of us split the cost of the two sites they use. given that I'm saved the cost of my own site, that's fine with me.

but for the first couple of years we've done this, we split it three ways. so my sister and her family, my other sister and her family, and I by myself pay an equal amount.

this didn't quite seem fair to me. one sister's family has four total, and the other has five. and again, I am only one person.

so this year I suggested we do per adult: my sisters, my brothers-in-law, and me. so a five- way split. that seemed a good compromise between per family and per person. while no one is angry about it, there is a perceptible tension and annoyance about it. 

it complicates matters that a) not having an RV, I don't have much of an ability to contribute perishable food to the endeavor. I do my best to contribute with snacks and such, but that's probably a bit uneven. then again, I'm only eating for one person; b) but I do a lot of the heavy lifting around camp, particularly for my parents who are getting older and not as able as they used to be; c) I'm the ""poor"" sibling, relatively speaking, so discussions of money can always get tense.

anyway, any time things like this come up I get the sense my sisters think I'm free-loading and taking advantage of their wealth and I'm just left confused if that's what I'm doing or if they're being unreasonable.",1690043736.0
AITA For Ruining My Mom’s Birthday?,2,156xbrk,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156xbrk/aita_for_ruining_my_moms_birthday/,17,"My (16F) maternal and paternal families were family friends even before my birth. There are photo albums of my mom and dad playing together as children, and I live in a small town so my entire family is pretty close knit. I really despise cheating (my past two boyfriends cheated on me). 

My mom is an identical twin, and I’ve always assumed her twin, my aunt, Emily, was dead from the way my family talked about her and the lack of older pictures. Recently, I’ve found out that’s false. 

Emily is alive, apparently ran away, and my family have no idea where she is now. My mom’s birthday was coming up, and I figured having her twin sister with her on her birthday would be a great present, so I found Emily on social media and contacted her. I told her I was her niece, and that I wanted to extend an invitation to my mom’s party. 

And here is when the true story came out. Emily was originally engaged to my dad, when my mom became pregnant. She put her wedding on hold to help her pregnant sister. A month before the due date, Emily found out that her fiancé (my dad) had cheated on her with her twin (my mom) and the baby her sister was carrying was her fiancé’s. Worse, my ENTIRE FAMILY had known and kept it a secret. Emily told me after she left, our family had never tried to contact her.

My family knows I hate cheaters. I was planning on talking to them, but my mom’s birthday was coming up and I didn’t want to upset her.

I don’t know what to do. I can’t look my parents in the eye. I feel nauseous whenever I do. My parents are pretty good parents, and I love them, but I kinda hate them. They married and had my two siblings after doing all those things to Emily. 

Today, on my mom’s birthday she started crying because she missed Emily (she does this on every birthday. Part of the reason I thought Emily was dead). That was kind of the last straw. I exploded, calling her, “A dog so desperate for attention she was willing to fuck her sisters fiancé to feel good about herself,” and, “You might have well killed Emily, so don’t start crying now,” and some other nasty things. When my dad started to yell at me, I yelled at him too and then the rest of my family. I told them I hate cheaters, I hate them, and I wish I wasn’t born to a bunch of cheating whores. I also told them that Emily had a family that they would never meet, that they never knew about, because of their actions. I then went up to my room and locked the door. 

I felt good for a few minutes, but after the anger left my system, I feel horrible. Not only did I insult them, but I did it in front of the younger members of the family, including my siblings. I hear my mom sobbing and some family members crying (which is really rare, as they aren’t big on emotions). I’m typing this to try and gain some perspective and I’m just wondering where to go from here. And how do I look at my family without being disgusted?",1690064970.0

The past few years they settle down and it has been better.
He is the father of my two kids, we were never a couple.
They met when my daughter was 1, and they split, and even though we didnt got back, I got pregnant again, and we were gonna try it for real, but it didnt work, I assume it was because of her.
He aleays has told me we cant make it, and it has been awful, I leave my hometown and live in his city, I have no family there.
He has been always around, he has been a good father, his child are his priority, he pays for everything, he has work hard and at first it wasnt easy, now we have a really good life, I live in a really nice neighborhood, one of the more expensive ones around, I have a nice car now, the kids are in the best school in town, and he pays for everything, food, services, vacation, I have no job, I have been fully dedicated to my kids.
For over the years we have been making travels and everything together, as a family, even though we all know we are not.
He live with her and it has been like that for years, my kids really like her, she is nice to them.
This year we are on this travel on this conference, for a condition my 10yo has, we decided to go as a family.
I decided to leave her my dog and my cat so she would be taking care of them while we were out.
As soon as we arrived, my 10yo start saying she should join us, in the moment I let myself go and support it.
The next day, they were talking about making it happend, and now, he told me she already got her ticket and they need to know what to do with my dog and cat.
I told them, it wasnt fair, I always manage myself and take car for those arrangments, I didnt think it will really happened! 
So, I say it, and she didnt came, she was taking a long trip and had everything already setup, I know the flights and everything wasnt cheap.
But if she comes nothing will be the same, I mean, she isnt bad, and is nice even to me, we have been seen us in family reunions and casual encounters and everything has been nice.
I wasnt ready for this, I did support the posibility cause I didnt think they would make it, and my kid was asking for it, and this trip is about him.

I think I should add, they have been “serious” and we haven’t, but since I am the mother of their child, I have been taking that place in the family. She doesnt want kids, they are a happy couple, and the even manage to work together, the company se owns, well, she has been an important part of it, so… I kinda know in some way, all we got now, is also hers…

AITA for thinking my friend is centering themselves in my drama?,2,156rol3,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156rol3/aita_for_thinking_my_friend_is_centering/,8,"About two and a half-ish months ago my (22 NB) bestie (24 NB) was “venting” (now it seems like they were just talking shit) about me to an acquaintance we both know in our local drag/burlesque scene. Upon “venting” about me this other girl (27/28? F) starts to talk down on me and say that she thinks I need to be “knocked down a peg”, that I’m a bad dancer, and even says she has a burner Instagram account that she’s debating on using to “put me in my place” (ya know, cyberbullying).

After telling me about this my bestie then asks me to not tell anyone as they don’t want this to “get out” because the girl who was talking down on me is really well liked and well known in the drag and burlesque community in our town. I semi-agreed (I only told people who aren’t in the community who are genuinely my good close friends of mine). 

Flash forward to now and my bestie has told at least 5-10 other people in the drag/burlesque community. Why? Because they said /they’re/having such a hard time dealing with this drama that they just “needed advice from others about how to deal with it”. They also have been name-dropping me in every conversation they’ve been having about it, but refraining from name-dropping the other girl, which I didn’t really like because I’m new to this community and I don’t want people to associate me with this kind of thing. 

Additionally, my bestie keeps having conversations with the girl who talked down on me as “damage control” because they want her to think that everything is fine. I don’t understand this. Why doesn’t my bestie just set boundaries with this person and move on? 

Finally, last night my bestie made an Instagram reel joking about the whole thing. Basically the video was about how new performers think the community is drama-free and friendly. This literally felt like they were making fun of me, but I didn’t say anything and just laughed it off. 

The whole time they’ve been talking to other people about this situation and talking about how “hard” this has been for them, stating that they’ve been having panic attacks and now are finding it hard to trust others because of this situation, I’ve just been thinking, “This literally doesn’t have anything to do with you except for the fact that you keep talking about it.” They also keep going on and on and on about how “over the drama” they are, but tbh, it feels like they’re enjoying this? Like, they literally made a comedic instagram reel about this shit. 

Throughout this whole 2.5 month ordeal my bestie has not once asked me how I’m doing or has asked me how I would like them to proceed with this, they’ve kind of just done whatever they’ve wanted to do or felt like was right to do. 

Last night my bestie and I (we also live together) got into a yelling match (one that I tried to avoid by attempting to physically leave our apartment) about the whole thing. They said what I was saying was “bullshit” and claimed that they “wished they never told me about the drama”. I yelled back that I wish they weren’t a pushover and that they set boundaries with the girl talking bad about me. They said that yesterday when they spoke on the phone with the girl that they did, so sarcastically I said “oh congratulations two months later you did the right thing”. They proceeded to call me a “bitch” so I called them a “stupid fucking cunt”. I know I shouldn’t have yelled or called them names, but to be fair I did tell them I didn’t want to talk about it when attempting to leave our home and they continued to yell at me even after I repeatedly told them I didn’t want to talk.

AITA for responding late to my friend's texts?,2,156rojb,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156rojb/aita_for_responding_late_to_my_friends_texts/,5,"So, I have a friend group and we often hang out on Discord to play games together in the evenings. These evenings never occur randomly, but are planned rather.  
  
One of the guys does this planning 99% of the time through personal texts or group-chat.  
  
Now, often times I can respond quite late to this. Could be an hour late, could be 6 hours late on occassions.  He has gotten mad at me on multiple occassions for this, especially when the answer is 'no'. When it's no, he also pressures me to explain why.  
  
I'm not always looking at my phone, and I don't want to. I'm not too fond of being 'available' at all times. I might have work, I might have a day out or a Netflix session with my girlfriend, or I just might not have my phone right in front of me. It could therefore take a while for me to respond. I've explained this multiple times already.  
  
I get that this could be perceived as annoying, but I still show up often even if I'm not fully in the mood for a gaming session.  
  
A few examples of some occassions and arguments, to get a grasp of the whole situation:  
  
As mentioned, when I say I'm not going to be on the Discord that night, he always needs to ask why.  
  
If my reasoning is not 'good enough': (having a terrible headache: ""oh c'mon, you only gotta be sitting down for it"", being with my girlfriend who I often sometimes only see once a week: ""oh c'mon can't you guys ever just do your own thing when you're together?"", not knowing my planning for the evening: ""just be flexible for once and join us tonight"", etc.)  
  
If I announce to leave the gaming session relatively early: ""oh you don't even need to get up early tomorrow, just a couple more matches/races/whatever"". Doesn't accept ""no"" and keeps pressuring.  
  
Now today he asked me again. I read his message, which he saw, but I did not respond at first. I was very busy at the time I read it and something came inbetween before I could respond. He texted me again, annoyed. I ended up responding 2 hours late from his first text with a ""yes, but I'm planning to go to bed early"".  
  
What followed is a response along the lines of ""just take a nap, just go for walk, just do something"". My response was that I'd like to decide that for myself. A small tirade followed from him, which in summary goes along the lines of him mentioned he's sick of waiting for responses, or me leaving the session 'early' for whatever reason. Mentioning I don't do anything and I just need to be flexible. Just adjust to others' schedules. I don't care about your bullshit excuses, etc.  
  
I mentioned again that he doesn't get to decide my own choices and my own schedule, and that he can come off as very pressuring. To which he responded ""You're the problem"".  
  
Just to be clear: out of the friend group, I'm probably the one who joins in the most. And 99% of times when I do announce to leave 'early' I would still stick around a bit after getting pressured.

When I say I said I mean I literally said just that. I wasn’t yelling or getting annoyed I just made the comment. He said “shut the fuck up” very aggressively. I was super taken aback by this because in my mind I was just making and obvious statement, he was being impatient. I said “woah why are you being mean to me?” And he said “me being mean? You just insulted me”. I was really confused I actually started tearing up because I didn’t understand what I had done wrong. He then started on me about playing the victim and how I was crying. I stopped talking and just looked out the window to diffuse the situation. He then said “oh okay great you insult me and then you give me the silent treatment”. I said I apologize I didn’t mean to insult you I’m sorry”. He said you’re not sorry and again went on about how I insulted him. I said (almost crying) I apologized to you I am sorry I didn’t mean it as an insult I am not sure what else to say please let me know what you want me to say. Anyway it just kept going and he was like you just won’t stop and I said I’m just responding to you but you’re talking over me. Why are you talking to me and asking questions and keeping this going but then saying I need to stop talking. We got home I gave the kids their food and went in the bedroom while everyone ate. My boyfriend then came in the room and said “wow now you’re not even going to eat”. I said I am I was just waiting for you to be done so we didn’t keep fighting I don’t want to fight with you.

I'm on a relatively tight budget so I tend to stay w/ friends (I've done this 2 or 3 times in total including current trip). I stay w/ 2 friends who offered to host me for free & I stay around 1.5 weeks with each friend. One of them, let's call her Clary (21F), is low socioeconomic class. Since the 1st time I stayed w/ her I told her i can invite you to eat out sometimes as thank you for letting me stay which she agreed to.

A few days prior to me arriving there on my current trip, the friends in group chat were organizing going out to eat. I asked Clary if she would come, she said no I'm tight on $$, I said well I can invite you a dish, she said I'm ashamed. Later i asked her to pick me up in the airport around midnight since the relative who was picking me up canceled. I paid for gas & a bit more than that, I also told her I'm inviting you to eat. I know she previously said she was ashamed of me inviting her to eat so I proposed giving her some money in advance which covers 80-90% of her consumption & she said fine. Additionally, I paid for the taxi on our way there. Once we had eaten I wanted to pay for my meal with a big bill & suddenly Clary said ""you should get X amount of change"", implying that I would pay for both mine & her meal with the big bill. I was like wtf I gave you some money already? I was kinda frustrated that Clary just decided this without discussing it w/ me first, she could've sent me a message or said that she didn't agree when I proposed to give her money in advance.

After eating some friend from our friend group proposed going to a club, we all agreed & got there in a taxi which cost we split. I ordered the cheapest drink & when we were paying I found out Clary ordered one which was double the price of mine & she expected me to pay (which we had not discussed prior). I was frustrated again but ended up paying bc Clary said she'd give me the money the next day. Then me & Clary got to her house in a taxi I paid for. I don't plan on asking her to give me the money back, I'd wait for her come up w/ it (if she does).

I'm at a lost on what to do here, I mean sure I'm staying at her house w/out paying rent but personally I see that as a favor like if Clary were to come visit me I would let her stay as long as she wanted w/out expecting anything in return. I don't know how to approach this topic, I don't want to create a conflict since I just got here & I'm staying w/ Clary for a week. I think Clary thinks I'm rich since I live in a rich country but I'm not. I think if I want Clary to come w/ me somewhere then sure it gives me reason to pay & also as thanks but I think it goes too far if I pay for all her consumptions even in a place in which Clary made the choice to go or not to go.

So the scene is, my brother has been for the past 10 years been taking one drug or the other, it started with weed then it moved on to some pretty hardcore stuff (md, cocaine). He did it occasionally and for ten years there used to be massive fights between my mother and him because of the little she knew. He used to show up completely wasted and my mom had found on multiple occasions his weed as well. It’s been a hell house when they’re fighting and this has been going for a good time, until quite recently he spiralled really badly and my parents got to know about the regularity of his drug abuse. He got fired, lost almost all of his money and is only now getting back on his feet. All my life the story has been around my brother, earlier it used to be about his lack of performance in school, then his parade of girlfriends and then about the drugs. So, home life has been about peacemaking, hyper independent existence and being blamed for some of the bullshit he pulls in anger. This is why I keep my friend circle completely different. 

Now my mother wants me to take him whenever I meet my friends so that he gets exposure to good people, his friends have stopped meeting him because they were all involved in the same ruckus. AITA for not taking him to meet my friends even once because I just can’t tolerate another aspect of my life being surrounded by catering to him and the needs of my family. 

Don’t get me wrong there is love, but from a very young age it’s been about me getting in the middle of fights, doing all the growing up myself (I never even asked for help for homework), and being excluded by my brother all my life in his social settings when we were younger because he mistrusted me as he though I would tell our mother everything. Funny because at the end he did it all himself. 
So why should I involve him in the one things that is mine, that is peaceful. One thing that helps me feel safe.

i recently found him on insta and we got in touch again. we hadn't met/spoken in 6-ish years, so it was nice. he was unrecognisable, he lost all the extra weight and looked tall and muscular. he seemed confident and i gotta admit i was happy seeing him all grown up. i noticed though that most of his posts revolved around gym stuff. i asked him about it, he told me that he was hitting the gym EVERY day in the interim, for 5-6 hours at a stretch. it doesn't take a doctor to know that much strenuous work without breaks is bad, especially for a young teen. but i bit my tongue and didn't confront him about his unhealthy gym habits. i had been out of his life for too long to have a say in what he does so wanted to be respectful. plus it was something he was passionate about, clearly, so i didn't wanna crap all over it. i simply congratulated him on the progress.

he on the other hand looked at a bunch of my photos, and started laughing at me. he told me i look like a walking skeleton and asked me how much weight i lost. which was weird because i knew i had put on 8kgs and was finally at a healthy BMI. so i yelled at him saying that if he can see my bones he must have some sort of x-ray vision. i asked him if he was joking, but he was serious - so i told him not to comment on people's bodies. i told him i didn't expect this from him, knowing very well this was a sensitive topic for me - and i know how much effort i took to reach a healthy weight. he never teased me (even jokingly) when i was ACTUALLY skinny so this hurt. i had put in effort to make myself healthier and i didn't appreciate him making jokes about my body. i told him that ""just because you think you're a man now in your brother's eyes, doesn't mean you get to crap all over someone who doesn't look like you. you are no different than him then. take your cocky attitude and get lost, this not the friend i remember.""

when i told this story to my gf she said i overreacted and should have ignored his comments, and that i only reacted because the ""cap fit me"". AITA for what i said to josh or did i indeed overreact?",1690028602.0
AITA for not reading my dad’s texts?,3,156nzpa,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156nzpa/aita_for_not_reading_my_dads_texts/,3,"throwaway account

My (15f) dad hasn’t really been in my life since I was little. He lives across the country from me and my family and really our only communication is through the occasional text message.

However, when we do text, he tends to send me huge blocks of text describing his life and everything that’s going on with him at the moment. I mean like a literal novel. It might be sweet of him to feel like he can trust me like that, but we don’t exactly have a Lorelai and Rory Gilmore type relationship. I barely text him and find myself responding with, “oh lol” “wow” or not even responding at all. I feel bad when he talks about his struggles, but it also makes me feel like he should be texting his friends this, not his daughter. Especially because he isn’t that present in my life.

He also has a tendency to make unannounced visits to my house without telling anyone. He did this once while we were on vacation and a family member from another household ended up picking him up (he doesn’t have a car).

My dad loves me very much (and I love him!) but I feel like our relationship is far too spotty for him to be treating me like a therapist. I hope that he finds someone else to vent to, because to be honest, I don’t really need him. I have an amazing close family and my stepfather is just spectacular.

I don’t know how to reply to my dad’s texts most days. I feel like I should tell him that I’m not happy with this relationship but I also get the feeling that I’m kind of the only thing he has in his life? So, AITA for ignoring/not reading them?

AITA for calling my godmother racist?,3,156nxz2,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156nxz2/aita_for_calling_my_godmother_racist/,7,"This is a semi WIBTA situation tbh. The context: my godmother (early 70s) is staying with myself (early 20s) and my family. We are not white. My godmother is the same race we are. I’ve faced a lot of racism growing up and subsequently now I’m older I’ve done a lot of work to try and help other POC kids in my position that face discrimination in schools etc alongside my day job. It’s something I care about deeply.

I was on a trip with my godmother last weekend and a song I really like and that has quite a deep meaning for me (she knows this) came on. She then said ‘some parts of that song reminds me of [x] culture. Yuck.’ with [x] referring to another POC minority that is not our own. The song itself is not made by people from that culture. However, she has a history of being… disapproving of [x] minority. I know she would never be racist to them if she was around them in public, but she has made it clear in private she doesn’t particularly like them. I have worked with, and helped kids from that background before, and given that our minority also deals with similar forms of discrimination (which she often complains about) I think that’s where some of my reaction came from. 

It shocked me at the time but tried to let it go. I was aware I was very tired on the day so I didn’t want to react impulsively. I told her gently that what she said could be taken as a racist comment. She said she wasn’t saying it in public and that she has the right to have an opinion. 

We left it at that.

I’ve sat on it this past week but tbh that moment has partially ruined the song for me. I listen to music on the days I work from home and every time it is on and she’s in the room I worry she’s going to say something racist about that group of people. It bothered me enough that I sat and properly worked through my thoughts about it on Thursday night and I worked out why this continued to bother me was more than just the loss of the song itself, so I gently raised it with her on Friday. She doubled down that she has the right to say and think what she likes in private and I said that while that’s true that doesn’t mean you need to exercise that right to say things that are racist, discriminatory or hurtful. She said I was abusing her rights to free speech by telling her what she said was offensive. 

I know she has a right to her opinion but I’m sad on two accounts. 1) that a song that meant so much to me is tarnished (it was tied to close memories of some friends and a hard time I got through) and that 2) that she’s tarnished it with a memory specifically of her racism, something that I have worked hard to push against, and that she thinks that kind of thing is fine ‘because it’s in private’.

I know it’s just a song and that other songs will come along but AITA for bringing it up again, AITA for expecting better from someone her age and WIBTA to double down and just not speak to her the rest of the time she is here? I would really appreciate some other perspectives.",1690041825.0
WIBTA if I refuse to make a favour to my friend out of spite ?,7,156il71,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156il71/wibta_if_i_refuse_to_make_a_favour_to_my_friend/,8,"TL;DR I accepted to switch rooms with my roommate so he can have sex with his GF without disturbing other roommates, he later was threatening for no valid reason and now I want to rescind my favour.

Hi.

I (24M) have 3 roommates for 9 months with next month being the last for work reasons. Each one of us will leave next month. I consider myself a respectful and kind person, I always care about what other people feel and I always make sure to not make them feel bad.

I have this 23M roommate, Juan, which is a friend but I resent him a little for not caring about my feelings as much as I do. I already told him to stop some joke that made me feel bad but he keeps doing it again. Once I even stormed out of a sport event because he made it again. I don’t think he has evil intent, he’s just forgetting because he’s not a caring person.

Juan has his GF coming over. He asked me if we could switch rooms because mine is isolated from the others and he fears he will disturb everyone by having sex. I felt he was unreasonable: I am in the same situation with my GF and we did not disturb anyone because we were cautious. I’ll have to pack anyway so I made him a favour to accept because I don’t need that specific room while he really felt he needed it.

Next, I had an interview for a new job in another city, went, got accepted. The interviewer asked me if I know Juan. That’s an insane request like how on earth does that man know him among all people in the country. He said Juan also voiced interest in the company and asked about his city preferences. I said that I don’t really know but he once told me he was looking for jobs in a totally different city but they should ask him about it. I told Juan the insane event that happened and that I pushed his resume for a job in the city he liked. He looked amused by the situation.

A few days later, Juan furiously stormed into my room without knocking and yelled at me in a threatening way that he wanted my specific job and that I lied so I would get the job and not him. I had better experiences related to the offer and there were many other applications. I was only chosen because I was the best fit. Moreover **I did not know** about his application and **I tried to help him** get a job where he initially wanted to go! There are many explanations and none are that I lied about his city preferences to disqualify him. He was not listening just yelling and threatening so I froze on my bed and stopped talking, he finally left.

Now I feel unsafe and I stay locked in my room and I don’t want to use the kitchen. I am pissed that he would ""attack"" me in my safe place. I resent him because he is making my last month here hard. I know the next time we’ll speak will be when his GF comes and he wants to change rooms. I intend to tell him to f\* off.

WIBTA if I refuse to change rooms out of spite because of the events?

I (27M) have 2 sister, an older Jessica (30F) and a younger (26F). Me parents are divorced and my dad is remarried. 

When I was 16 my parents split due to my mom having an affair with a friend of mines dad. I was at the age where I could decide who to live with. I choose my dad. My sisters choose to shuffle back and forth. Me and my sisters have never been close afterwards. I have not spoken to my mom since I graduated back in 2014 and my sisters have been bitching about it since. My sisters don’t like my step mom while I love her, so they don’t come to my dads much which we are both fine with. I don’t speak to them unless necessary around the Hollidays. 

I did not attend my older sisters wedding due to the tension so I’ve never met her husband. I’m currently engaged and our wedding is in December. I planned to invite both my sisters for the sake of my fiancé who wanted them there. My younger sister isn’t coming because I did not invite my mom and instead have my step mom involved and I’m happy with that. My older sister pretends to be this big family person on social media so I think for appearances she was going to come. After I sent the invite she called and said it wasn’t right to phase our mom out considering her side of the family will be there. I said I didn’t ask her advice on the guest list. She said in solidarity with our other sister and our mother she isn’t coming. I said great. That was a month ago.  

Last week I got a call from a random number who ended up being my BIL saying he spoke with my sister and she wanted to come. I said that isn’t what she said originally. He said she was trying to force something and that was wrong and she wanted to attend. I said it was too late as the offer had been rescinded. He said that family was important and it would be a good step. I asked who the hell he even was… as I’ve never even met him. He said my sister is too proud to call so he did it for her. I said it was too bad her ego was that big that she’d allow her husband do her dirty work so there was no invite. I pretty much told the guy that family wasn’t that important given I don’t even know who he is and that his wife tried to  threaten me, so I was done with it. He said a few other things about family and I just laughed at him telling him I don’t even know him, they obviously want a free dinner and he should get his balls back from my sister. My fiancé heard most of the convo and said I was being an AH to him, even if my sister was toxic. I told her that the asshole thing is to call on your wife’s behalf about an issue that doesn’t concern you. And to threaten your sibling with shit to get them to do what you want.

AITA for making a couples group of people in my community?,0,156wcgc,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156wcgc/aita_for_making_a_couples_group_of_people_in_my/,9,"Hi guys, quick question.  Me and a number of my friends grew up in California,  in a very specific type of Jewish community.  A big part of our community's tradition is the idea that we marry within the community.  This has NOTHING to do with prejudice, or any type of thinking relating to our community being better than other communities.  It's just something we do to keep our traditions and culture strong. 

Myself, and many of my friends all decided to marry in. Easy enough, there's thousands of potential spouses. Not impossible to find one you click with. But a few made the choice to marry out,  and we supported them and wished them the best. We all talk and are friends, but they understand they're not a part of the community anymore. A fact they choose they were okay with because they wanted to marry their spouse. Honestly cheers to that, and I'm happy for them.

Me and a few of us who married in were talking,  and we're thinking of making a couples group of people within our community.  To help demonstrate to our kids the importance of our community,  and show them you can be successful in America while staying true to your culture. Also to demonstrate how important the community and culture is to us. We want them to have a social community of like minded people who they can relate to on a deeper level since the family ties go back hundreds of years, and the values in our community are very useful. 

However, some people feel like we're being exclusionary towards the individuals who choose to marry out. I disagree because they choose to marry out, obviously knowing that meant they're not part of the community anymore.  I support them, but I don't think we're at fault for wanting a group of us who choose to marry in. Espically since there are traditions and histories within our culture we want to make sure our children and grandchildren inherit. 

So wanted to ask, is it wrong of us?",1690062531.0
AITA for asking my (30F) partner (30M) to use a helmet when biking?,2,156qsfd,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156qsfd/aita_for_asking_my_30f_partner_30m_to_use_a/,8,"AITA for asking my (30F) partner (30M) to wear a helmet while biking?

I (30F) have been supporting my partner (30M) throughout his health journey. A month into dating, he developed a chronic condition that involves his blood dropping to near 0 platelets - at low levels it means internal or external wounds don’t stop bleeding. 

Physical impact from a fall impacting his organs can be high risk with irreversible brain damage on head impact. Not to mention any type of surgery. People who have this illness usually take a lot of precautions.

I’m happy to see my partner biking in his home city with a helmet. It’s a fun activity and he is close to his health care there. He has loved ones close by to help bring him. I value his spontaneous nature. 

However, the other month my partner travelled alone to a different country and took a bike around for a week without a helmet.

He was cutting down on meds so it was a definite risk. 

I told him it may be safer to use a helmet, or avoid biking temporarily until he can see if the decrease in dosage keeps his levels normal. I offered to remotely cover some Uber rides instead. 

That being said, he had a huge reaction to me asking him to wear a helmet in the foreign city. 

He shared his version to his therapist who told him it seems “I’m making him responsible for how I feel”, and I’m “enmeshed”. I feel like this take is dangerous because it glosses over the fact that this negligence can create a domino effect.

Paradoxically this condition has gained him a lot of sympathy, but there’s a double standard where my compassion is suddenly devalued here.

I feel hurt. I’ve dropped everything to be with him in the hospital. It feels discouraging to take care of him if he has the option to make temporary adjustments, but he rejects using resources with a few more safeguards. Access isn’t the issue at all.

He said “everyone bikes with no helmet here” - I doubt they have the same condition.

I myself have recovered from an illness where I had to restrict a lot of my usual lifestyle habits, and so I absolutely empathise with him.

While at their house, I had to take a shit pretty bad. Shitting in the girls’ bathroom felt a little wierd so I decided to go to the one next door in my friend’s room. I had slept over in his room and used his shower in the past so I didn’t see a problem.

While shitting, my friend comes home from the park not knowing that I was in his bathroom. I don’t remember exactly what was said, but he wasn’t okay with it. Once I was done, he had already left the house to go back to the park. I ended up going back too and when I did, it seemed like he was ignoring me. I sincerely apologized to him, but added that if our positions would be swapped, I would be fine with it. At one point, he told the other friends that all but one of us should go to one of their houses to chill there. Obviously offended, I apologized again, but he didn’t care and said that I’m no longer welcome in his house. The other friends seemed to side with me a little, telling him to just let me come. I ended up just walking home to avoid further drama. 

I told my mom about the situation and she sided with me. A couple of days later, my parents went out with my friend’s parents for dinner. My mom went out of her way not to bring up the shituation, but when my friend’s mom brought it up saying that her son told her that he had asked me not to shit it his bathroom many times and that I was ignoring his requests (not true), my mom “exploded.”

I said ok I will use our second vehicle. Well then my car broke down and we decided to trade both older vehicles in for a new one. Then we told the in-laws that things changed and they can not use my new car. They didn’t like that so my husband told me to cancel my plans his parents are taking my car. I have to pick them up and drop them off at the airport. My special needs son and I will have no car to go grocery shopping, doctors if needed. I’m mad but he says I have no right to be mad. His parents have 4 incomes between the two of them. I don’t work, so we only have my husband’s income. They can afford a rental we can not. My husband says I’m being unreasonable. AITA?  Edit: hubby has his car. I call the new one mine even though he paid for it. 

Update: thank y’all for helping.  Most of y’all said he is wrong. Some of you said he was wrong for putting his parents feelings above mine. So I told him late last night that I won’t go without my car to take my son places. What if he has an emergency. I can get the the er in my car in 5 minutes. It takes the ambulance 25 minutes to get here then 5 to the er. If he still disagrees we will be going to my parents that live 2 hours away. So he apologized said he wasn’t thinking and his parents will be getting a rental. Thank y’all so much for the support 🥰",1690002845.0
AITA for agreeing with my sister when she said she was horrible?,2858,155amri,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155amri/aita_for_agreeing_with_my_sister_when_she_said/,321,"I (20f) have an older sister Laura (29f). Laura has three kids, the youngest of which is Freya (6f).

I'm autistic, and was diagnosed when I was around 11 or 12. Growing up, my family didn't really understand autism even after my diagnosis. My parents and Laura would always make fun of or get angry at my traits. If I didn't want to sit through a loud party because I was overwhelmed, I was considered disrespectful. If I didn't want to eat one specific food because of the texture, I should be punished.

When I was 13, Laura recorded me having a sensory meltdown because of loud music blaring through the house for hours and she sent it to all her friends to laugh at me. This is just an example of one of many incidents.

Now I'm just a regular functioning adult living away from them.

A few months ago, my niece Freya was diagnosed with autism, which I found out because Laura posted about it on Facebook. Ever since, her entire social media has been exclusively lots of posts DAILY about how difficult it is to be an autism parent.

Last weekend, Laura threw a small family party for Freya's 6th birthday. Every 5 minutes, Laura would somehow mention that Freya was diagnosed with autism. 

Eventually me and my sister were chatting in private after the party and she said that she feels guilty for how she treated me growing up, that she was horrible and that she wishes it was different. I was matter-of-fact and agreed with her, yes she was horrible and I wish it was different too, and you should feel guilty.

Laura seemed shocked at my reaction, and said that she's sorry. She said I'm being cold and unforgiving and that people make mistakes, and she didn't know any better. I didn't get a chance to respond because she stormed off into her room and her husband told me it was better if I left.

My parents are now on my case about it all and saying I'm not treating her like family.",1689905825.0

Second, this is my property that I have a mortgage on. It’s not community or city property.

This past winter, I had a pool installed at my house. After the pool installation, I had my old fence removed and installed new fences that met with the city code for a residential pool. My new fence is higher than my old one and the gates have approved locks. 

About a month ago I had to travel for work and was gone for about 2 weeks. I came back to find my backyard trashed and it seems someone had a pool party while I was gone. The locks on my gates were broken but luckily no one broke into my house. I checked my security cameras and saw at least 20 teens having an all day party that lasted late into the night. I did not give permission for anyone to be at my house so I was mad. My cameras are HD so their faces were clearly visible and i recognized some from the neighborhood. I went to the police and submitted a copy of the recordings and tried to file a report. The cops did their best to try to talk my out of it but I pressed them on it until they relented and took a report. Weeks passed by and I heard nothing so I called them to find out nothing has been done. I got angry and threaten to sue unless they got off their behinds and enforce the laws. 

I should point out I live in a town of about 2000 people and nothing ever happens here. The cops are not understaffed or too busy on other cases. I also know I probably can’t sue the cops into doing their jobs but I loose nothing by threatening a lawsuit and I was mad at the time.

Finally they got some of the teens seen on my security video but again they tried to talk me out of pressing charges. I was adamant and insist they file charges. 

When my girlfriend found out about the situation, she said I should have let it go and we got into an argument about it. My own mother thinks I’m being a bully by forcing the cops to file charges against some teens who just wanted to throw a party. Virtually everyone I know is making me out to be some grumpy guy with a score to settle and I kid you not, everyone in my life is trying to talk me out of it. They’re worried about me destroying these teens’ future over a pool party.

I don’t know when it became okay to break into someone’s property. Right now it feels like it’s me against the entire world.

Update

I’m so glad I posted my situation here. Many of you pointed out that the cops might know the kids so that’s why they’re dragging the case. I never thought of that because I’ve only lived here for 2 years. You all opened my eyes!

I called my buddy who grew up and still live here so I invited him to dinner tonight. I asked him about my situation and showed him my security vid. He immediately said about half of the HS senior class was in the vid (his kids are in the same HS) and he recognized the daughter and niece of the mayor. He also told me he thinks a couple of the kids belong to the local prominent families one of which own one of the local grocery stores. 

We talked about it and I decided to take your advice and drop my complaint in exchange for the parents paying the damages. I’ll call the cops tomorrow about it. 

There is a post below about someone’s uncle living in Oklahoma who made a complaint and subsequently got pulled over repeatedly for phantom traffic violations. That really opened my eyes and I definitely do not want that to happen to me.",1689891228.0

I went on a birthday trip to NYC for my birthday for about a week, and during that trip he turned off read receipts while I was away. Admittedly I do have some insecurities about this, and I think it's weird to abruptly turn them off. I asked him politely why he did and he just kept avoiding the question. I didn't necessarily react to the avoidance too well and blew up on him for something thats seemingly trivial, I feel guilty and like the asshole for not having enough trust to brush it off, nonetheless it is still just weird to me...  I got upset because I have asked 4 different times with different answers each time.   
One of them being that I had mine off, I've never had mine off. Another one being that we got into an argument and thats why he turned it off (not true, did not have an argument.) When I asked another time he blew it off and just said ""watch this instagram video i just sent you."" It is just very weird to me... I don't necessarily care about the read receipts themselves (trivial) but I'm more-so concerned with the avoidance of a simple question: ""Why did you turn off your read receipts?""  
He has the complete right to change his privacy settings, I can respect that, but avoiding the question is bringing back up those insecurities from previous experiences. Yes, him being unfaithful is crossing my mind but we have been together so long, I genuinely don't care about the receipts, rather why are you not answering a simple question. I'm also aware that I may have overreacted, but we have been dating so long that I would expect him not to ignore the question – which does make me suspicious. I know I shouldn't be, objectively IT IS TRIVIAL. But this is how I feel and it shouldn't be invalidated. Being honest and answering the question is the bare minimum I feel like.  
I would rather have an actual civil conversation about it without making a deal – the avoidance just seriously irks me. He's in his right to turn them off, I'm in my right to have feelings, feelings are always valid, albeit I maybe reading too much into it - nonetheless, everyone's feelings towards any situation is valid regardless if they're wrong. If he's irked himself... ALSO COMPLETELY VALID. Feelings are valid and this is how I'm honestly feeling so please don't attack me on this post.   
\*\*TL;DR;\*\* : My partner of 7 years turned off his read receipts and when asked why he avoided and ignored the question several times. Makes me suspicious theres something more to this. Am I the asshole for reacting to this? ",1690059873.0

AITA for wanting my brother and/or parents to repair my bike?,10,156e954,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156e954/aita_for_wanting_my_brother_andor_parents_to/,17,"About 5 years ago, my (26F) brother (37M) started to work as a delivery guy for uber eats or another service like that. But he didn't have his own bike and couldn't afford one. Our parents first decided to borrow him my mother's bike, which was stolen under his watch. As he still needed to work, our parents decided to borrow him my bike. They didn't ask for my agreement, or even just tell me about it.

At that time, I had moved out of my parents house for a like 6 months and was living 6 driving hours away from them. I had phone calls with my mother about every other week and I took the train to visite them each time I had a week off from Uni.

My relationship with my parents was slowly starting to deteriorate because of a lot of stuff that happend before I moved. Someday, during a regular call with my mother, she told me that my brother broke my bike. I was surprised. She explained to me the whole situation and she said that her and my father would pay for my bike's repairs and then would get my brother to pay them back because he broke it.

We never talked about it again, first because I had no way to get my bike back at the time, and then because 2 years later, I ended up going NC with my parents and LC with almost everyone else in the family. The rupture was sudden, so I haven't been able to get back all the stuff that I had left at my parents house, including my bike. Last year, my parents offered to let me come to their house while they were away on vacation but warned me too late so I couldn't make it. This year I planned it ahead in order to finally get my stuff back.

As it's been so long, I asked my brother about the bike and he told me it wasn't fixed as far as he knows but would ask our parents. He didn't get back to me, so I messaged my mother about it. She confirmed that the bike isn't repaired and that the repairs would cost about 80 euros.

I cannot afford it, and considering that the bike was borrowed to my brother without my consent, I consider that it's my brother and/or parents responsibility to get it repaired before I go to their house so I can grab it. Especially as they told me they would do it 5 years ago, 2 years before I cut contact with them. My parents do not agree. They said that the repairs are expensive, and that as I decided to go NC with them, they don't owe me anything now. And my brother, on his side, cannot seem to be bothered about it, even though he has a stable well paying job now (he brags about it quite often).

So... AITA for wanting my bike back, and that either my brother or my parents pay for it to be fixes before I come to their place ?",1690014013.0
AITA for telling my co-worker her comments were racist in a team meeting?,228,155qnlo,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155qnlo/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_her_comments_were/,153,"I (30sF)/biracial. Co-worker (A) is 20sF/white. 

Recently there was an issue with an employee who spoke to a customer who said he was happy he got to speak with ""an american"" and not ""an illegal"". The employee on the recorded line agreed with him and made jokes for an hour. 

The employee was terminated and told his friends at work what happened, so word got around. 

The company I work for is big on diversity and inclusion, so we had voluntary team meetings to talk. They offered any volunteer to speak on how they've dealt with any form of discrimination and to discuss how they felt at our company and if we need better practices in place. 

One co-worker, P (30sM-black) has become a good friend and we've discussed how we both grew up in predominantly white spaces in small towns (less than 1k) in red states/areas. 

In the meeting, P spoke about how he felt at prior jobs, his experiences, how he's been treated, and how he felt here. 

When finished, he said ""OP has a good perspective since she grew up similarly, but had different reactions from people as a WOC""

I'd didn't expect to be called on, but I decided to share.

A spoke up when i finished: ""OP, that's a great story and all, but you have 0 right to comment on this since you're white and have only ever known privilege. You just want people to feel bad so you can play victim. Let real POC talk""

I asked A why she felt that way. She said it's clear I was white because of my name and voice, that I was just trying to get pitied and play a race card that I didn't have. She said I didn't sound like a black person and that my name is clearly a white name (it's a common name mostly seen with white women but not exclusive to them. As for my voice, I have a slight ""country"" twang. Imo a voice is just a voice and people sound how they sound. Her argument was that my voice didn't ""sound black"" and that you could tell other coworkers were actually black from their ""accents"") 

I told her those kind of remarks are racist and she's stereotyping POC by stating if they don't present one way, they aren't really POC. I told her that people of all races have different names and voices but it doesn't take away from who they are. 

The sups then ended the meeting and immediately made a chat with themselves, me, A and 2 of the shift leads. They said to wait as we would all meet shortly. 

While waiting, I've had multiple co-workers message me saying that I was wrong to call A out and should have done it privately, that if A loses her job it's my fault and I should feel bad since she's a single mom and will lose everything. They told me to drop the ""black charade"" because my ""lying"" will cost A her job. 

I did not mean to get A in any trouble or cost her her job. I feel like what she said was uncalled for. But now I'm thinking I should have waited and messaged her privately instead of publicly.

Soon, my YOUNGEST great aunt turns 80, and she has 5 siblings. 


We have family get-togethers about once every 2 years, but during the last one, our side of the family (my grandma, mother and my siblings' families) felt like we were being snubbed and looked down upon for very stupid reasons (job decisions, not being as well off financially, having ""too many"" children or patchwork families...). We handled it as politely as we could, but aren't looking forward to going to the get-together next year - it's more of a ""I've known these people for decades, and they might die soon"" feeling at this point when we think about going. 


Now, as mentioned, one of my great aunts has a birthday coming up. And my mother  isn't invited for ""seating reasons"", while my uncle, who hasn't even been to any of the regular get-togethers, is. My grandmother is hurt that one of her children is excluded, while great aunt invited even estranged adopted children of one of her other sisters, partners and all. 


My mother, understandably hurt, decided not to go to any more of the big get-togethers, but, equally understandably, doesn't want to influence her children one way or the other. 


I'm still leaning towards taking my husband and children to the event next year, partly because it could be the last time I see any of the older relatives, partly because I can't feasible visit all my cousins separately (some live abroad, but there's just sooo many of them). But I'm pretty on edge about the whole thing, and I feel like I might explode as soon as the next conflict presents itself. 


Now, here's the question: Would I be justified to give my 80+ year old relatives and some of their children (all my parents' ages) a piece of my mind IF the get-together goes the way the last one did, or would it make me an asshole to lay bare the ways they have hurt our side of the family, including me, and confronting them about things that, at the time of the event, will be over a year in the past?


I know most of my older relatives won't easily change anymore, but I also believe in NOT accepting things for how they are because they've been that way for so long. I could just not go, but that would feel cowardly, as well. If I go and stand my/our ground, I might cause an irreparable rift, but I feel like there's so many undercurrents already...

So I, (15m) Love to cook. In fact, I plan on making it my job one day, if possible. Tonight I was cooking for my girlfriend and her friends because she had been bragging about my cooking and they wanted to try it. I was making steamed garlic mushroom chicken and I was planning on trying a new recipe for rice that I had been tweaking, bamboo shoot and spring green onion rice, Japanese style. This particular rice has a very mild flavor, and any added ingredient could destroy it.

While I was prepping the chicken, my Mom was complaining about the lack of vegetables in the meal. (apparently the mushrooms, onion, and bamboo wasn't enough) I ignored her suggestions of what to add to make it ""more healthy"" and finished prepping the chicken, put it into the cooker, and moved onto the rice. I cut the green onion and sliced up the bamboo shoots and threw it into the rice cooker. I heard the doorbell ring and assumed it was my girlfriend so I asked my mom to set the rice cooker for 45 minutes while I talked to them. I opened The door, said hello and led them to our living room, and told them dinner would be ready in 50 min. I checked on the rice cooker and it was set for the right time, so I figured everything was fine.

45 minutes later, after I had got the chicken out to cool I opened the rice cooker to see there were slimy green leaves in it. Spinach. I tasted it, and it was ruined. fuck. I quickly packed it into a container and put it in the fridge. I went out and grabbed my guests and told them that unfortunately something went wrong with the rice so we would only have the chicken. Everyone ate, and after everyone had left, I got into an argument with my mom about the ruined rice in which she denied any wrongdoing and said she was only trying to help. I eventually yelled ""MOM, IT WAS MY F\*ING RICE WHICH YOU RUINED, AND YOU DONT EVEN CARE!"" She has been giving me the cold shoulder ever since, and I feel bad for yelling at her.

AITA for “venting” and thinking out loud?,2,156uc9a,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156uc9a/aita_for_venting_and_thinking_out_loud/,99,"I’ve started to notice a pattern of feedback from a few romantic partners and friends, and I’m starting to question things. 

It was my understanding that it’s healthy to talk about things like how your day is going, the ups and downs, how you felt, etc. Especially with your partner. I also thought it was healthy/okay to talk out problems you’re having so that you can organize your thoughts (for things like if you’re unsure about whether you want to change your career, or whether you’re not sure if you were wrong in an argument with your friend, or whether you should buy a new or used car, I dunno, normal problems/decisions).

However, the feedback I’ve been getting is that I require too much emotional support, ask too much of other people, interrogate, and am a pessimistic downer. Which admittedly is confusing for me because I can’t really see any of that, although I’m trying to keep an open mind and be receptive to feedback. 

I definitely am an extrovert and a talker, and usually this feedback comes from introverts, but I do try to be aware of other people’s energy limits and not overwhelm them (because I’ve been around tons of strong extroverts like that who don’t seem to understand how draining they are talking nonstop). 

I also am very curious. I like to question things and understand how the world works. For example, I may see that a business made a new change and wonder out loud why they make that decision, since XYZ factors don’t make it seem logical. I may ponder out loud about the reasons people act or say certain things because I’m very interested in psychology and sociology. I’m also a helpless problem solver and I may suggest changes or talk out loud ways to improve things.  I guess these things could easily come off as criticism, and sometimes it is, but usually it’s just me trying to understand the world. 

I can definitely understand the accusations of being interrogative. I ask a million questions, without a doubt. But I feel like interrogative has a connotation of being “mean” or having an agenda, and I don’t do it to be hurtful or mean. I feel like it’s more just annoying, like a kid asking why over and over.  I never grew out of that. But I will stop if someone expresses it’s bothering them. 

So I definitely understand annoying, but I don’t see where the excessive emotional support claims are coming from or the pessimistic downer claims. If I’m pessimistic, I feel like it’s mostly coming from the constant criticism that I don’t understand and don’t know what to with. It’s not like I can adjust my behavior to accommodate other people’s needs based on non-constructive criticism, so it feels needlessly and unproductively hurtful.

WIBTA if I introduce my daughter to my GF,3,156ojvd,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156ojvd/wibta_if_i_introduce_my_daughter_to_my_gf/,23,"I (M48) got divorced 7 years ago and for the first time since I have met someone I really care about. It’s only been a couple of months, but I haven’t felt this way about anyone before and I am really excited about the future for the first time in a really, really long time. 

My daughter (F15) spends most of the year in another state and I get to see her over the summer, on holidays, and on long weekends. We talk or text most days. She’s a really awesome kid. She just got here Thursday and my girlfriend and I made plans to take her kids (M17 and F14) and my daughter out so everyone could meet each other this weekend. I want them to get together and do something fun so that my daughter can meet this nice woman I am with and her daughter who is about the same age.

Here’s where I may be the AH. My daughter is neurodivergent and she developed an eating disorder last year, and last summer was all about making sure she ate all of her food at specific times. This year, her counselor wasn’t sure she should come out which was really confusing to me since she is doing better. Her counselor said that she was in a delicate place in her recovery and she needed to prove that she could handle getting her own food - and she did. She really wanted to come see me and I am so proud of her.

Since the time that I was told she was in a delicate place, all I have heard about is how awesome she is doing, but when I told her mom that I was going to have her meet my GF and her kids this weekend, she got really upset and told me that it was way too soon. She said that when I first told my daughter about my GF and her kids, my daughter asked if I would like my girlfriend’s daughter better than I like her because I would get to see her more, and that now, on her first weekend here I would be forcing her into a social situation (which is hard for her because of her neurodivergence) and putting a lot of pressure on that meeting going well. She thinks I should wait until I have been dating my GF for at least six months, and that since I don’t get to see my daughter very often, I should be focusing my attention on her. 

I haven’t dated anyone in a long time. When I started looking a couple of years ago (2021), my daughter broke down crying and asked what would happen if I got another family that I liked more than I like her. So I stopped using the apps because I didn’t want to do that to her. But now I am finally working through my intimacy and trust issues, and letting someone get close to me and having somebody care for me, and her mom is telling me that I have to put my kids feelings first. But I have done that for the past 5+ years!

AITA for telling my husband I don’t want him wearing a motorcycle helmet with naked women on it?,56,1562k7v,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1562k7v/aita_for_telling_my_husband_i_dont_want_him/,99,"
My husband recently purchased a motorcycle helmet from one of his friends. The helmet is covered in graffiti type pictures of half naked to completely naked women and has comments such as “naughty boy” and “spread eagle” on it. I don’t think it’s appropriate for a married man to wear this as I think it projects the wrong idea. For reference my husband is 32, tattoo’d and gets enough attention without this adding to it. He said that he wouldn’t wear it if we were riding together because he knows that would be inappropriate. But, AITA for telling him I don’t want him to wear it at all? Or is this actually inappropriate and giving off the wrong idea about a married man?  Just to add, I don’t think he’s going to attract women with this helmet. I think the helmet is disrespectful to women, in turn disrespecting his wife and marriage. If that clears it up?",1689979058.0

AITA for defending my friend?,0,156t260,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156t260/aita_for_defending_my_friend/,30,"A couple months ago I was at a get together with some friends. We were watching a UFC fight and drinking. We decided to sit out the dining room table and talk amongst each other. Now there was 6 people at this table, including myself. We were all talking, shooting the shit and then my friends girlfriend decided to talk about my best friends relationship that had just failed recently. Be aware, that girls best friend was dating my best friend. Apparently it didn't end well.  
Let's call my best friend Ben. And let's call the girl Tiffany. Bens gf we will call Maria.  
Tiffany explained to the group that Ben was a misogynist bigot, who dumped Maria over text and told her that he was having a hard time loving her so he ended it after 10 months together. However, Tiffany was throwing in extra shade towards Ben just because I believe she was trying to make him out to be the bad guy. Now Tiffany's boyfriend (CJ) was silent the entire time and didn't comment on what was being said. He didn't stop her or anything. After that entire night was done I had a bad taste in my mouth, just because it didn't feel right that these people were bashing on my best friend right in front of me. Even CJ just sat there and did nothing.  


A week passes by and I finally have the courage to tell Ben what happened that night. I didn't make anything up, I only told him the truth. I only told Ben what they said exactly that night. Ben was really pissed at this point, so he decided to confront CJ about what happened. Ben caught him off guard at the gym and all he could say was ""I'm going to find out who told you all this stuff because they're being shady."" Two days passed and me an Ben had a chat with CJ over Discord. Ben and I spoke to CJ separately because CJ  was going on a work trip somewhere so we caught him at a bad time. However, I explained to CJ that I wanted to fix this entire thing peacefully and come to some resolve. CJ tried to take control of the conversation by big broing us saying, ""I won't talk to both of you at the same time, only one at a time. And if you guys don't like Tiffany or be cool with her then I can't be cool with ya'll."" I literally told CJ that I only told Ben what was said that night and how I didn't think it was cool for all of us to be bashing or driving this narrative that Ben was a bad guy.   


I know my best friend too well and he's a great guy. Yes, sometimes he can say dumb stuff related to misogny, but it is all jokes and it doesn't come from a bad place. Ben was the guy who helped me through a dark time in my life so I felt the need to stand up for him. Anyways, after the conversation with Cj the group dismantled and we haven't talked in almost a year.

He took care of her so much that she got so used to not having to do anything for herself. Once my sister was born you could immediately tell that my mom was not fit to raise another child. For the first year of my little sisters life my mom began distancing herself from me. I just thought it was normal being a 9 year old kid who payed for her own phone and cleaned the whole house every other day with out help from either parent. My step dad would tell me to go to my room while he finished up cleaning and he would tell my mom that i cleaned instead of him finishing the cleaning. When my sister turned two my mom began complaining about watching her and started leaving her with me everyday. I think for about 2 more years she only spent 1 hour a day with my little sister while i took complete care of her as if she was my own kid. My mom and i had a conversation last week and i told her how i felt. I got into detail about how she complains about doing everything but really she only does the bare minimum. I was only 14 and i now pay two of the biggest bills for the house. I told her that i get she works but it bothers me that she blames her laziness on her disability. Then she told me all i do is go to school and that is so easy so i can’t be telling her these things like i have so much experience. i excused myself to my room. I woke up to next morning to the cold shoulder from my mom and she wouldn’t talk to be until today she went off on me over text this morning saying how i have no place to be saying things about parenting or working and that i have no idea what she feels like hearing that from a child she already regretted having.

All of a sudden I've had my girlfriend's sister's birthday sprung on me.
My girlfriend doesn't really want to go, but is obligated too because it's very rare they see each other.
I know my girlfriend's mum, dad, and other two sisters well, we are all friends. But this sister distanced herself from the family until very recently. I've never met her or her friends. The family going( excluding the ones just mentioned ) don't talk to me or anything really and I often feel uncomfortable at these events. The family members I do know wonder off socialising with others leaving me behind. I do try to socialise but oftens I just get a smile or a quick comment and they just wonder off of to have a laugh with someone else. It just feels awkward and if I knew this sister I would definitely come despite that.
This person hasn't made an effort to see us or include us before, so I just don't feel like I need to go.
If I could drive then sure, I would pop over and see them to say hi,etc. But as I don't drive I'm kinda stuck there throughout it.
On top of all this, my girlfriend knows I hate doing anything last minute. I need some kind of structure otherwise I stress. This was literally spring on me 15 mins ago and we would need to leave to go to the party in 20mins time

She loves cracking jokes and making people laugh. However, the problem is that Sarah's jokes often come across as awkward or confusing, and her classmates end up laughing at her, not with her.

I volunteer at Sarah's school, and during recess, I observed this happening several times. Sarah would share a joke, and her classmates would giggle, but it seemed clear they were not laughing because they found the joke funny. Instead, it seemed like they were laughing at how silly or strange the jokes were. For example: Sarah has been obsessed with Queen Elizabeth and often makes random comparisons between Queen Elizabeth and random objects.

I felt conflicted about what to do. On one hand, I wanted to encourage Sarah's sense of humor and creativity, but on the other hand, I didn't want her to be oblivious to the fact that she might be the subject of ridicule. 

So, I decided to have a conversation with her about it.In a gentle and supportive manner, I spoke to Sarah about her jokes and how it's okay to enjoy making people laugh, but it's essential to be aware of their reactions. I told her that while some jokes might be funny to her, others might not find them amusing, and that's okay too. I wanted her to understand that sometimes people laugh for different reasons, and it's crucial to be attuned to their feelings.

Sarah got upset by our conversation and felt like I was criticizing her sense of humor. She argued that she was just having fun and that her classmates were laughing, so she must be doing something right. I reassured her that I wasn't trying to dampen her spirit but rather help her navigate social dynamics better.

Now I'm wondering if I made the right decision by discussing this with her. Should I have just let her enjoy her jokes without pointing out that some kids might be laughing at her, not with her? Did I unintentionally discourage her from expressing herself freely?

My husband is worried I made Sarah self-conscious about her jokes and that she might stop expressing herself altogether. He argues that it's essential for kids to be free to explore their sense of humor without the burden of being judged by others. I agree with that completely but felt it wrong that she didn't know.

I (F20) have been responsible for cleaning, making doctor’s appointments, filling out documents (taxes, medical reports, etc.) and organisational matters for my family for over 8 years. My parents and I are first generation immigrants, we had some difficulties initially with language barriers. However, when we moved to our now home country I was quite young and thus, also more receptive of learning the country’s language. The moment I started primary school, I became an unofficial Dolmetscher for my parents for occasions such as doctor’s visit, official legal stuff, teacher-parent conferences and so on. This put a great deal of pressure on me, especially because I didn’t possess the high language level to be able to understand legal texts. I was insulted because of my incompetence to do so but gradually learnt and acquired the skills over the years.

Now, I am struggling with severe mental health issues and besides studying at uni and working part-time and sometimes full-time, I cannot possibly do all these chores anymore. I am so extremely exhausted and I feel this intense dread every time they tell me to do something. Even for my younger siblings’ school administration, I did all the work by printing out documents, filling out stuff, emailing schools, attending the first talks with the head of the school etc. I also am responsible for making doctors appointments for my whole family and preparing medical reports for the visit. Since I am the only one with a driver’s license, they also depend on me w that.

Anyways, yesterday I had a fight with my mom because she demanded I make an appointment for my younger brother (11) the moment I woke up. She didn’t even leave time to properly wake up and just handed me the phone. Because this isnt a single occurrence and kind of was my last straw for this week, I confronted her and told her that shes been using me as her secretary and that a lot if the stuff i do she can also do herself. She called me ungrateful and told me about how many chores she had to cover when she was younger. She also made it seem as if I complained about making one phone call because for her its like easy stuff and i complain about it. I work full time right now because its now summer holidays and when i come home and eat she refuses to wash my plate (washing dishes is no problem for me but she washed all of them Except mine?). Shes now telling all our relatives how ungrateful and spoiled i am and my dad also sees me now as an ungrateful asshole.

Upon picking her up I noticed my daughter had a lollipop in her mouth. Being only 3 years old this isn't something I'm comfortable with due to the choking risk and have also told her about this before and asked her not to do it. I told her at this point that I wasn't happy with this and she straight away tried to justify her actions and I cut her off, said its not acceptable and went to leave. At this point I'm tired and want to go home and don't have the patience to deal with her so yeah. 

She then decided to start shouting at me and telling me ""this is the last time you disrespect me in my own home"", came after me to the door and was shouting an inch from my face, bear in mind my child is standing right next to me and is screaming for her to stop. I took my daughter and walked to the car. I should also mention I am 6 months pregnant and felt her manner was very aggressive. 

Let me just say that this is not the first time she has overstepped a boundary. She has been caught multiple times smoking out of her 'back door' which is situated in her living room while my child is in said room and after me asking her not to do this she agreed. The next time I came over to collect my child the flat stunk of cigarettes and upon me asking she said that it's okay because my child was asleep in another room and not in the room with her. She has also told my family members personal information about me when she is at the school gates as if its hot gossip and when asked not to do this she tries to pass it off as being concerned for her grandchild. (Of which she has no reason to be at all, child is provided for fully emotionally and physically.) Whereas my daughter is constantly having trips/falls and accidents when she is with her nan (I do understand that kids are gonna kid but I feel it is everytime.) She has also made some comments that are definitely overstepping and has made me uncomfortable multiple times. I have always just put up with it out of respect for my daughter and the bond they have. 

Fast forward to today when ex tells me that my daughter is going to spend the night at his mother's while he is supposed to have her. I tell him I'm not comfortable with this as it will be unsupervised and due to the most recent incident with her I just don't trust her to keep my daughter out of harms way anymore. He responded to this by saying I don't have a choice and that she is sorry but I just don't trust her. We ended up arguing with me telling him that since we don't have any court orders in place I'll just pick her up and bring her with me and that if I have any issues doing so I'll be calling the police. He called me an asshole amongst other things until i just refused to listen to him any longer.

We've talked about relationships, mostly my relationships, before. I asked him what he looks for and why he doesn't date much. He said he only dates women who are members of his religion.

Someone new (F19) joined our group recently, and we instantly became close friends. She and I have a ton in common. She told me the other day that she wants to date (M20) and is trying to put out signals. I told her that he doesn't really date and probably isn't going to ask her out. She was hurt and asked why I would say that, so I explained what he told me.

I thought that was the end of it, but she called me last night, pretty upset. She said she asked him to go out for drinks with her, and while they were out, she told him she liked him. He explained the same thing I told her. She said she had never experienced religious discrimination before, and it was horrible.

I asked her what she was talking about. She said being turned down for a date for not having the right religious beliefs was an awful experience, and discrimination is a terrible thing to face. I told her she was being ridiculous and that no one was discriminating against her. She told me she was being discriminated against. I said if every guy she ever turned down called discrimination, she'd be the biggest bigot in the world. She said it wasn't the same, because she never turned anyone down over religion. I said she's acting like an entitled brat and needs to chill.

She said I'm a horrible friend and a nasty person. Today she refused to speak to me at all, so I think I might have gone overboard with the entitled brat comment.",1690051590.0
AITA for making my mom cry over a bracelet?,113,155u30t,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155u30t/aita_for_making_my_mom_cry_over_a_bracelet/,38,"I (16) argued with my mom over a bracelet. For some background information my mother does something when I set jewelry on a counter or table and it gets knocked off or if I drop it without knowing she sees it and claims it was on the floor (I don't know for sure) she picks it up, puts it on and decides to see how many days she can wear it without me knowing.

Well, a couple months ago I had a multi-colored beaded bracelet that I had gotten from my grandmother. The elastic was old and I could see it was stretching out so I decided to not wear it anymore in fear I'd break and I'd lose the beads. A few days after that I noticed my mom was wearing it. I called her out on how she is wearing my bracelet and never asked to do so, and I had a good reason for not wearing it. Her response was to get offended by how she found the bracelet on the floor and because she is my mother she has the right to wear it.

I decided not to push the topic further and make her more mad. After that day I assumed she took it off and left it on her nightstand as she usually does when she does this and I'd just ask for it back later.Fast forward a few days I got in the car and in the cup holder I saw the bracelet broken with a few loose beads. This made me angry because I knew this would happen, plus I was never informed of my broken bracelet. It was just left there.

After seeing this I went to my mom and mentioned how she borrowed the bracelet the other day and wondered if I could get it back without saying I knew it was broken. She told me it broke and acted like I've known since it happened and shrugged it off saying she'll fix it eventually. This made me angry and I wanted to pick a fight with her for breaking my things, not telling me, and shrugging it off so easily. Since then I've been pretty broken up about the bracelet. It was one of my favorites and I was pretty sad. I waited a few months to see if she'd take the beads out of the car and fix it but she never did.

Today I decided to pick up the beads and she noticed and asked what I was doing. I told her I was picking up the beads of my broken bracelet and then I noticed beads were missing. I said some beads were missing and she replied I know. I assumed this entire time all the beads were there but some were missing in the car and she never bothered to find them.

This was the last straw so I glared at her with a 'are you freaking kidding me face' and instantly she started to cry. She claimed that she was tired, she was hurting, having a really bad day starting some new medication and she doesn't understand why everyone is angry at her. She says I'm being too emotional over a bracelet, it was an accident, and that she said she would fix it. In the end she complained how I was being moody and how I'm going to ruin my mood and everyone else around by being angry about a bracelet all day.

AITA for letting my parents fight?,1,156ruoc,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156ruoc/aita_for_letting_my_parents_fight/,35,"**Throwaway**

My mom (F42) was out of town most of yesterday to visit her sister (F39), leaving me (F16) and my dad (M44) at home. My dad had left his car at work the day before (as he and my mom work at the same place, and they sometimes drive back together), so we only had my mom's car at home.

My mom's car is pretty new, so only my parents have been driving it. I have a license, but since I'm still pretty new to driving, I usually just drive my dad's car.

After my mom left, I was planning on going to hang out at the mall with some of my friends. My dad promised to take me, but about an hour before we were supposed to leave, he apologized and said he had a migraine and vertigo and didn't think he could drive me. When it gets hot outside, my dad typical doe get migraines, so I understood despite being a little annoyed.

More importantly, I was supposed to be picking up some of my friends on the way, so I waited until my dad went to take a nap, and I decided to carefully take my mom's car.

On the way to the mall, I picked up my friends and we were having fun chatting and listening to music. While pulling into the drive-thru at a Starbucks, I accidentally scraped a bit of my mom's car. We got out to check on the car and saw that some paint had come off, and there was a smallish dent.

One of my friends (Katie F17), suggested we head home early instead of continuing with our plans, and we all agreed. When I got home, my dad woke up a bit later and was feeling better, so he went out to run some errands. He's a pretty absent minded guy, so he didn't notice the damage on the car.

My mom however did. She came home at night, and as she was walking up to the front door of the house, she noticed the damage and told us about it. She seemed very upset and asked if we knew anything about it.

My dad said he didn't notice anything when he went out, and my mom looked furious at this. After I went up to my room, I could hear her accusing him of being careless and not respecting her stuff. 

My dad said that he didn't notice the damage, and that he didn't know how it happened. They argued about the car and some other things for a good while. After they stopped arguing, I could definitely still feel tension and my dad ended up sleeping in the living room over night.

This morning, my dad did apologize to my mom and said that he would pay for the repairs and take better care of her things.

This afternoon, I was talking to my friend Emily (F16), about what happened and she said that she thinks I should just come clean. I told her that the situation had largely worked itself out, but she then said I was being a bit of an ass.

AITA for making my neighbour's kids cry because I humiliated them?,5036,155336v,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155336v/aita_for_making_my_neighbours_kids_cry_because_i/,728,"For context, I ( F18) live with my 2 siblings, (F22), (M24) 

recently, new people moved in right next to us, and they have kids. They were a bit loud, which was a bit annoying, but they were kids and kids do that. 

I didn't really have a problem with them until they started ding dong ditching us. I don't even know if it could be considered ding-dong ditching because they literally kick the door like they're trying to impersonate the FBI. They hang out in front of our house and do it every 10-20 minutes, keep in mind they kick HARD. My sister was going to call the police in a fit of rage but I told her no, because talking to their parents or calling the police might make it worse. I don't know the kid's situation at home, confronting the parents might make it bad for them. 

But they keep doing it, more often, and harder. There are literally dents and scuffs on the door ( I don't even know how its possible because the kids look 10), and I'm seriously getting annoyed, along with my siblings. They clearly don't see the security camera right in front of the door, so I know their intelligence is lacking, so I'm not gonna yell at them. So I wrote a sign in front of the door, kindly asking them to stop because my siblings work from home and it is extremely distracting. 

But it keeps happening, they rip up the sign and spit on it. So I can't take it anymore, I slip on some socks and slippers and go next door to talk to the parents. The mom said it's not that big of a deal, my door wasn't seriously damaged, and that they were just kids and trying to have fun. And if its that distracting, I should put on some headphones. 

But my last straw is when these kids mess with my package outside the door and shake it and throw the box against the stairs. I snap and decided to take screenshots of all the security footage of them being little menaces. 

I make a poster, with their face on it, the damage that they've done to them, and photo evidence of them being menaces. I type out "" Neighbours be on the lookout! Local doorstep gremlins may terrorize your front door!"" which I found funny at the time. I print it out and tape it all over the neighbourhood. My other neighbour finds it hilarious, because those kids have been doing the same to her and she confronted the parent too, and the parent did nothing. 

but today I got a giant knock on the door, and it wasn't the little snot-nosed kids, it was the mom!

she called me a b-word and an ahole for humiliating her kids, she said that her kids were crying and were now to traumatized to go outside. She yells at me, and drops pieces of the ripped-up poster on my doormat, and walks away. 

&#x200B;

Am I the asshole, or did those kids have it coming? 

&#x200B;

EDIT: haha I did not expect for this to blow up! 😅 but I am here to clarify things. 

1.) why didn’t I call the police in the first place? Well because they couldn’t do much more then give the “ Dont do this! Don’t do that!” Talk. The scuffs are dents aren’t even that bad that bad, ugly but maybe a paint pen and some rice will fix it. 

Another reason I didn’t call the police in the first place is because I didn’t know the situation that these children had at home. Calling the police could of enraged the parents and made things bad for the children, I didn’t know if their home life was troubled at the time. 

But as soon as I saw what their mother acted like, I saw a reason to humiliate them 😅 I find that younger kids have a giant fear of being embarrassed, and not coming off as cool as they seem to be. 

2.) what did I say to the mother? I just said that it was extremely distracting and disrespectful. I told her that there were dents and scuffs on the door and I showed her the video evidence in the phone. I politely asked for her to talk to her children to tell them that this was effecting us negatively, and you already know the answer! 

3.) will I call the police if this happens again? Yes—and no. 911 is reserved for real emergencies, and I’m sure there’s more serious problems then some neighborhood brats. Resources are plenty but thin, I don’t want to take them up. If this does happen again, I won’t call 911, I’ll just file a complaint or call a non emergency line.",1689886760.0
AITA for giving my friend a taste of his medicine,2,156lva6,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156lva6/aita_for_giving_my_friend_a_taste_of_his_medicine/,5,"Let me start this off by saying me and my friend (call him John) have been really close for almost 2 years. Since about last year we fight all the time. Admittedly this WAS my fault and I continued this for unfortunately a couple of months. When I realised I was in the wrong I have been making a constant effort to be a better an a nicer person.

Now to recent day: I have been a lot nicer and we are now close again. But recently (in my opinion he has been) meaner and not really that nice to me. For example yesterday we were playing some fill warzone, and were talking to random queued people. We found these people and got some reason I think he wanted to show off to them. (I am not exactly sure has done this a couple times with other people) We keep playing with them because it was fun, though the whole time I’m just getting insulted for existing. ( at the time idek know what I did, though he said it was because I was darker, but I am hardly of the tone). I remember muting my mic and saying to myself “if I do the same he will get mad”. After we are done playing he says to me “you can say whatever when we are playing cod”

So we are playing tonight when we load into a match and we just landed and he insults me (sorry I’m a bit cloudy on the exact words but it’s like your shit at the game or something like that) so I reply “you have been dead for 95% of the past two games we have played” he tries to tell me to shut up and I in a mocking voice tell him “whatever is said in cod stays in cod” (Ik it wasn’t really what he said but he got the point) and then he leaves.

My friend makes me apologise (on the grounds that he wants to play with both me and him) So I apologise, fast forward abt 2 hours and I have been taking insults bit by bit to the point where I confront him. I talk to him about it and we got nowhere. The conversation was like:

Me: “Why are you always insulting me and getting when I do the same”

John: “because it’s not the same yours is always meaner”

Me: “but is not I take countless shots from you all day but when I speak out or dish it back I am at fault”

Other Friend: can you both stop fighting

John: “OP u beta”

Friend 2: laughs

I go silent. 

TL;DR: Friend gets mad at insults I dish it back and he leaves. Then confront him and he calls me a beta and then threatens me.

Context: We are both 14m, so I get the beta thing seeming far fetched, but he used it as a joke and as a threat.

Also when he is with other people they are having much more fun and are much more lively than with us.",1690036830.0
AITA for going to dinner with Friends behind my directors back?,2,156ls0s,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156ls0s/aita_for_going_to_dinner_with_friends_behind_my/,17,"So, I (14M) am in a play, it’s like a 2 week camp thing where we make the set and learn the play. About halfway through, the 2 asst. directors invited me and a few other older cast members to dinner, along with the main director. Well, the next day, she decides to invite all of the other, younger kids, who don’t behave well, to the same place, without asking the 2 people who had originally planned it, but She made it clear that it was not a requirement to go. 

Well, the asst. directors decide to invite the original group to a different restaurant, and the main director was going to the og restaurant with the other kids.  Apparently  they did not run it by the director beforehand, and decided to just not go with her.  Well, I did not know this, until we were on The way.   

So, when we were seated, we were talking, and suddenly, the director and other campers were blowing up our phones. After about 5 minutes, the director bursts through the back door of the restaurant, stands in between two of my friends chairs, looks at everyone, nods, and walks out and slams the door.

Everyone, (including myself,) wrote an apology to her, basically how we could have went about the situation better, and that we shouldn’t have done it. I don’t feel as if I did anything wrong, but I did not intend to hurt her feelings as she has been an amazing director, and gave me the lead role. She only responded to me and my friend, (a cast member,) and ghosted the two helpers, but the directors best friend  messaged the asst directors, saying “y’all really know how to BS”

That night, I found out that, after dinner, she went and got wasted at a bar with another helper In the play, which is probably why her message to me Seemed kind. The show is tonight, and I’m terrified to show up, I know I have to, but the energy is going to be so different.

My brother and I each had our own bedrooms, but since my aunt came we started to share a room. I don't like it, but at the time I had to understand and be the biggest person.

My brother and I made our arrangements for the space in the room and we started sharing it just fine, but when the warm months started the ac on my aunt's room broke (the heat in my country is barely bearable without ac) so she started to taking her mattress into my room without asking or considering us.

At first we understood and we were kind towards her, but she became rude af when time started passing, she stopped knocking, started using my things without asking and barely saying ""please"", and even uses my stuff without cleaning it afterwards (leaves her lose hairs on my hair brush)

I said he accuses ME of doing 'reckless' stuff with our daughter all the time, and here he is, ready to take off without her being in a car seat!

We've recently had some issues with people using the pool after hours. Pool closes at 9 - early for my preference - but that's the rule. We've had some noise issues, people leaving trash etc, enough that it was being discussed at our recent meetings. We've also had a concern for the security of the cleaning staff who come after hours. Some people are dues-paying members, but others are trespassing.

I've started walking the neighborhood after 10 PM since we started having complaints, but tonight was the first time I ran into people (members) at the pool after hours, around 10:15. They seemed pretty chill, but I still let them know the pool was closed and implied they should leave.

Am I the asshole? They weren't specifically making a problem other than being there late, but I still feel like a jerk for asking them to leave. They are indeed paying for the pool, like everyone else. Should I only enforce the rule for people being rowdy and look the other way for chill people?

Editing to add: I also effectively singled them out, since I don't monitor the pool continuously through the night. They just happened to be there when I was nearby. It's possible others might also try to use the pool later or they might come back.",1690002569.0

AITA for unintentionally not inviting my friend to play games?,2,156qouu,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156qouu/aita_for_unintentionally_not_inviting_my_friend/,2,"My friend (16F) is giving us a little attitude because we played games without inviting her initially. Let's just call her Martha for the sake of clarity and just cuz it's easier for me. I'd like to start off by saying that we have separate friend groups that we initially invite whenever we want to play any game. Despite this case, we welcome any friend to play with us if they wanted to join or reach out to us to play a different game.

My friends and I generally are just bored over the summer and often find things to do, like play some video games together. We have a close-knit circle and often invite each other to play, or just hang out in general. Although, we also have a lot of other mutual friends that we are all close with and we would always welcome to play with us at any given available time. 

A few days ago, Martha invited me to play a game. I was busy at the time when she invited me, but was down to join. I just told her to wait a few minutes for me to join the game. She mentioned that she already invited one of my close friends to play. Minutes later, Martha said she didn't want to play anymore because she found out that the friend she invited was already playing a game with one of our other friends. I asked her why she didn't want to play anymore, then said something along the lines of ""maybe they didn't invite because they must wanna play alone together, I don't want to join them"" I explained to her that maybe they did not deliberately try to leave her out of the experience and was free to join whenever. Some people may have exclusive invitations to casual gaming but this was not the case for us. She was seemingly sad about finding out that she wasn't invited beforehand. I eventually gave up trying to persuade her to join them, but then she gave in and kinda had a ""fine, let's play"" moment.

Earlier this day, my circle decided to play and as I mentioned earlier, we initially invite each other to play, but totally welcome other friends. It becomes this thing where we don't really go out of our way or feel obliged to invite other people to play with us. While we were playing, Martha hit us up to play a different game.

For context, we were in the middle of a game and had progress we didn't want to lose, however we also wanted to play with her. I instead invited her to come play with us as it was a fun horror game, but said she didn't like to play horror games and told us to enjoy the game without her. We felt that we'd done something wrong and felt guilty we didn't invite her. I continued to stress to her that it was okay if she joined the game and could switch games if she didn't like the one we were playing. She told us it was okay and it would be a small thing to get upset over, when we weren't really implying we thought she was upset. It felt like one of those times when somebody says they're fine but they're not really fine. 

We're genuinely confused. We aren't trying to intentionally leave any of our friends out. AITA?

if i hadn't called her at 4pm i would've gone over to her place & waited by the door like an idiot. also, if you went to the lunch, which btw you said you weren't going to, & knew you were gonna be late why couldn't you tell me earlier? i don't really have many friends but i had a niece (13F) ask me if she could go to the movie w me a while ago & i had to say no, if you had told me at least an hour before the show, i could have called her instead, someone who actually wanted to watch the movie w me.

i talked about this with this guy i'm seeing and i specifically told him i just wanted to rant. despite that he tried to give me her perspective & said i should try to see that in the end she did come to watch the movie meaning she wanted to spend time with me.
anyway, i did not confront or lash out at anyone despite being mad. i know they'd get defensive & honestly i didn't want to deal with it. aita here for being upset or should i just be thankful that in the end she did watch the movie with me.",1690034352.0
AITA for looking at other jobs while on leave?,1,156q64o,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156q64o/aita_for_looking_at_other_jobs_while_on_leave/,7,"Recently I took some personal/ medical leave from work ( 1 month+). While home and recovering I decided to look at other jobs not necessarily applying for them though I might occasionally just as a joke. You know those ones with higher paying jobs that you definitely aren’t qualified for, though if you did however manage to land it that would be amazing and you would totally accept it. 
While a coworker asked me what I did on leave and I told them that jokingly. Apparently though they aren’t amused even though they are actively looking to leave the company. I was told that it was an … move and that I should have applied only to thing I qualified for and was serious about. Though they were even more upset that I was trying to leave because other people deserved it more and that my leave was so I can heal and not just try to abandon my job. 
A lot of my other coworkers where told about this and thought I did nothing wrong as many of them occasionally apply else where to in their free time, and they know I have voiced many times that I was not happy with my current job. Others however thought I as a major A for applying for this I didn’t qualify for as it’s taking away from those who put in the work. Others are upset that if I would have gotten accepted than I would have either put in my 2 weeks while I was on leave or when just coming back and that I should have waited to apply till later in the year. 
Either way I don’t see the problem as I still came to work and do my job with no problem, I don’t complain , and I am trying to work on my qualifications for jobs I want later on as I knew this was not my forever job. AITA for apply to other jobs while I was on leave.
To add why the coworker might be mad. The coworker who was initially mad, was particularly upset because they had previously applied for one of the jobs and was declined even though meeting the qualifications. So far after a week I have not been declined but have been called to clarify/ verify a few things which is more than what they got.",1690047241.0

I do a lot of driving for work, especially on motorways. I’ve always tried to be a considerate road user and as much as it makes my blood boil watching all these morons sit in the third lane of the motorway doing 65mph when there are 2 empty lanes to their left, I’d never go out of my way to call them out on it.

I was driving late last night and doing 70 in the left hand lane. I saw ahead of me a vehicle in the third lane doing, I guess, 65-67 mph. I indicated and moved all the way over to the fourth lane to overtake and then headed all the way back across to the left lane. I proceeded to drive for another 20 or so miles overtaking as needed and matey boy continued to sit in the third lane the entire way unable to maintain a constant speed. 

I pulled into the services to grab a coffee and matey boy followed me in. Not sure if this was a planned stop for him as well and just coincidence. Anyway, I got out the car and he’s a few spaces away from me and makes his way over. He then proceeds to start shouting at how I’m dangerous and all my ‘weaving’ is going to cause an accident. I replied calmly stating that doing 65 in the third lane would cause more accidents as it would encourage people to undertake on his left. 

At this point he absolutely blows up in my face and I’d had enough. I ended up shouting back and dropped a few profanities. Unbeknownst to me at the time, the back window of his car was open and his kid was watching our interaction.

The entire summer I left my money alone and didn’t spend any of it, except the other day I went to grab my ID from my hiding place and all of my money was gone.

I wear headphones (really good ones I bought that has ANC) to cancel out most noises as I literally sit in the living room. I do not have my own room but share with my 2 sisters.

I am very particular with the way I study. All lights are off, except my desk lamp, I set a timer (for no particular reason), and play some random youtube playlist. I literally will not study without listening to music. Most of the time it's the more ambient kind that I tune out 90% of the time (think CAS), sometimes it's more upbeat and I sing along if I have really easy hw. The latter is rare. With music, I can study like 3 hours at a time, completely focused I feel like. Normally I just go for like 1 hour and snap some people then go back.

As I sit in the living room, it is sometimes inconvenient to follow my requirements, as I call it. People can still cook and stuff, just not watch TV (which is like 2m away from me) and the main light NEEDS to be off. I don't kick people out or anything, I will just stop studying because I genuinely cannot. Maybe I made myself this way idk, but I think it's fair.

My mum thinks I should be able to study regardless, because ""there are people in the streets studying"" (good for them). Also I should not listen to music at all because it's distracting, which is a fair point, but I feel like in my case is kinda different. Also if I'm not studying I'm not allowed on my table (where my laptop is). Like no wiggle room whatsoever. Scrolling reddit on the computer? Go somewhere else. 15min quick break? Get off the table.

We were having a dinner party at a mutual friend's (18F) place with all 3 of us and our parents.

The family is blowing up with drama right now because of what I (and my wife) did. I must preface this by saying my family can be pushovers, they really all hate conflict and will definitely let themselves be run over by someone else in order to not cause a fight. I am not this way. 

The wedding was on Saturday. Catholic ceremony in a church that was at 3:30 PM. The reception area was at a brewery about 15 minutes from the church. The reception was set to start at 5. Maybe this was stupid on the venue people, but they wouldn’t open the bar or bring around the appetizers until the bride and groom arrived. 

Service ended around 430 and everyone was told to go to the reception. The wedding party had a limo to take them and a separate limo took the parents, grandparents, siblings. The couple is young and decided against family in the wedding party lol. It was 4 sorority sisters and fraternity brothers on each side.  My wife and I drove. We got to the venue around 4:50 with the first family limo arriving around that time. By 5 I’d say all 150 guests were there..but no bride and groom. The wedding coordinator was getting *pissed* as it’s now 5:45 and no wedding party. We are all just standing around with no food or drinks. 

Someone was able to get ahold of the MOH around this point and apparently the bride and groom told the limo driver to stop at a liquor store and then drive around on the highway for an hour so the wedding party could get trashed. At around 6 the MOH said they should be arriving in the next 20 minutes. 

My wife and I looked at eachother and said we are out. We thought it was horribly disrespectful for them to do that to all their guests. I told my brother (FoB) that we were leaving and taking the gift with us. He tried to plead by saying “they’re just kids let them have fun” but I was having none of it.

Since we moved into our home almost 20 years ago, we have not had a microwave. My parents have simply refused to get one, my mom says we don’t have enough counter space. I always thought that was just not true. All we have to do is make space, plus I always thought it was really inconvenient not having a microwave. I started thinking, one day I’m just gonna buy one, so I did. 

Of course my mom was mad. I knew she was going to say no if I asked, so I didn’t ask, but I figured it would be a purchase that the whole family could use and she’d end up liking it. When she started complaining about that it was taking up her counter space, I said that the reason we don’t have counter space is because the kitchen is usually messy so we just have to move stuff. She got triggered by that statement and snapped at me saying “don’t say that to me. Who’s the one who’s always leaving a mess, I’m trying my best constantly cleaning up after everyone”. Then she walked away. 

That turned into another argument, because I was upset that she was holding that resentment. I feel like I clean up after myself and she doesn’t recognize that, and that she doesn’t have to clean up after us and then hold it as resentment and say it’s not a problem until it is. She said that I was challenging her and disrespecting her authority as a parent. I was like I’m not a kid anymore. I was angry cause she kept walking away and she was the one who misconstrued what I was saying in the first place. I wasn’t criticizing her or trying to attack her, and she got upset as if I was. 

Later when we were calm we were trying to dissect the argument and she kept insisting that I was disrespecting her and she couldn’t believe I was talking to her that way(although she was saying this in a calm way). I was trying to explain to her that I was making sense to me. Eventually I was asking her why she felt so disrespected and it all went back to the fact that I went against her wishes and brought home a microwave when I knew she wouldn’t like it. 

I said I understood that she felt disrespected that I went against her wishes, but I’m at an age where I can make my own decisions and my parents aren’t always going to like them. She has this whole beautiful home where everything is how she wants it, where I’m confined to my childhood bedroom, so I felt like it was ok to be a bit selfish with this decision to purchase an appliance with my own money. Plus I wanted to laugh because it was all over a microwave.

Edit: To everyone telling me to move out as a solution cause I’m old enough or maybe as a jab, that’s just not gonna happen anytime soon nor is it a constructive comment for my situation. Of course that would be ideal, and that’s my goal. But it’s not attainable right now, not til I graduate from college in a couple years. I’m considering moving the microwave to my room, so thanks to those who are suggesting that. Actually constructive and not condescending.",1690005031.0

The problem started two nights ago when we were together at my place watching Star Wars. Since we had both seen it before we were chatting and making jokes throughout. About halfway in, Jake made a comment about how pretty Padme was and how the silk nightdress was his favourite outfit. I also think Natalie Portman is pretty, so I agreed but said my favourite was the lakeside dress. In response to this, Jake gave me a weird look and pulled away. I thought it was odd but brushed it off. For the rest of the movie, Jake barely responded to any of my comments and pulled out his phone to scroll through twitter instead of watching.

By the time the movie was over, I was admittedly kind of annoyed so I asked him what was wrong. He ignored my question and started gathering his things. I followed him and asked again, as our plan had been  to sleep at mine and get breakfast in the morning before work. Once he'd gathered all his things he finally replied.

Basically, Jake said that I had made him uncomfortable with my comment about Natalie Portman. He said it was gross and he didn't feel like I should be making ""sexual"" comments about other females. He said he didn't want to stay the night. Finally, he yelled at me, saying I should know why he's upset.

I was absolutely baffled, and ended up just letting him leave. 

I am bisexual. My only other serious relationship was with another woman, let's call her Katie (24) during my first years of university. We broke up amicably about 2 months before the party where I met Jake as she moved back to her home country. Jake knows all this about me. We met at a Pride party, where I explicitly told him I was bisexual. During the months of texting it was mentioned and acknowledged by us both multiple times. On one of our first dates we talked about past relationships and I told him about Katie. Jake is straight, but he knew when we started dating and he told me it didn't matter to him and he was just happy to be together. 

This is why I was so confused by his reaction. The next day we talked on the phone and I asked him to explain what was so wrong with what I'd said. He kept saying it was ""inappropriate"" and that I should know why he's upset. I started to get frustrated and asked him why I was in the wrong and yet he was fine when in essence we said the exact same thing, the only difference which dress we thought was better. I asked him if it was because I am attracted to women but he denied. I said I was sorry he was uncomfortable but I'm not going to apologise because I dont think I said anything wrong. He hung up on me and hasn't talked to me since. 

Our friend group are pretty split, with some saying I am TA and should just apologise and others saying I'm am not TA, he's acting weird and I didn't say anything wrong. AITA",1689890353.0

Last night my wife was not tired and decided to take a bath before bed. We usually go to bed at the same time, but I was tired from a long day in the sun and proceeded to bed anyways. I put on a podcast that came out three days prior on ironically about Jonah Hill’s text messages. I had heard the first few minutes before, but must’ve fallen asleep the last time while listening because the majority of the podcast was new to me. 

I ended up being really interested in the podcast and was continuing to listen. When my wife came to bed, I was mostly asleep and she asked me to turn the podcast off as she had already heard it and wanted to turn a different one on on her phone. I declined stating that I was listening and that she could turn hers on when mine was over or if I fell asleep. 

A minute later, though I was still awake my wife walked around the bed to my phone, and turned off my podcast I was listening to. She went back to her side of the bed and I turned the podcast back on and told her that I was still listening to it. My wife got mad and went to sleep in another room clearly upset at my decision. 

I commonly feel as I make many sacrifices for my wife, but that she does not do the same for me but that this ask was unfair as I was enjoying the podcast. 

So Reddit, AITA? Should I have turned off my podcast and just gone along with it?",1690013246.0
AITA for bailing on a family wedding because of my boyfriend's inappropriate relationship with his female cousin?,1,156ouum,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156ouum/aita_for_bailing_on_a_family_wedding_because_of/,35,"My bf (24M) and I(24F) have been together for 2 years and his dad is getting remarried today, which is why his brother and niece(22F) came from Europe. She's never been to the US before so the first thing she did was go to NYC for a week. On the last 3 days of her 7 day NYC stay, my bf and I flew in and joined her, and then we were going to drive to his dad's place and stay there this whole week leading up to the wedding. In the 3 days we spent with her, she gave off the worst vibe. 


Both she and my bf are only kids, and they would spend their summers together growing up, but their relationship and her behavior made me uncomfortable. She was really doing too much around him, like you do not need to wear a cocktail dress that shows the shape of your nipples to brunch or be dressed to the nines to walk around NY, or have my boyfriend sing 80s love balads on karaoke with you. She would also pretend to forget words in English even tho she is fluent just to switch to her native language with my boyfriend, or when our server was French she HAD to make it known that she speaks perfect French too. And everytime we would see her she would greet my bf with a hug and kiss to cheek, not me.


I confronted my bf about this and he called me jealous saying she doesn't kiss me when saying hi because he warned her about Americans preferring their personal space, but she could've asked me if I would be okay with it! He says her over the top behavior is a cultural difference and nothing more. I wanted us to get a hotel in his dad's town, to get away from her, but he said no. I decided to go along with it because I figured maybe I WAS overreacting, so on Monday we drove to his dad's house. 

My bf's dad and I have a great relationship and as we both work in finance, we love discussing it which always leads into fun political debates as well. She would be all chatty until I start a conversation about something, and then she wouldn't say a word, like she was freezing me out. I booked us a make up artist to come do our make up for the wedding who ended up canceling on us yesterday. The cousin said she would do both our make up, and to have my make up ready in the morning. I told her I only have like 3 products because I don't wear it on a daily basis like she does and then she told me she couldn't do my make up because she doesn't like sharing her make up products as it's unhygienic. But you're okay with a makeup person using their stuff on you?! Come on!


After that, I went and she and my bf went on a walk while I was showering so I couldn't join them, after we've been going on post dinner walks together all week! That was my tipping point, so I packed my bag and left this morning without saying a word. I texted my bf all of this and he acted surprised, said I behaved and like a child and that he won't let this ruin his dad's wedding. AITA?",1690044054.0
AITA for not letting my husband buy concert tickets for himself and his mom?,8,156cq66,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156cq66/aita_for_not_letting_my_husband_buy_concert/,15,"My husband thought it’d be nice of him to “take his mom to the Luis Miguel concert” in San Diego. I told him that would be nice. Until the next day he was about to purchase the tickets and I saw he was buying $2200 worth of tickets. I asked him why one ticket was so expensive. It turns out he was buying one for his mom - “taking his mom” meaning buying her a ticket which is misunderstood for physically driving her to the concert. I thought he was only buying a ticket for himself. I thought dropping $2200 for one night was pretty steep but I told him we should consider canceling a trip to Vegas we had been planning  next month to avoid a lot of spending. We were looking at airbnbs in Vegas for a weekend for about $1400 (it was a nice house with a pool). He said I was being cheap and unreasonable. I told him he needed to compromise and either do one or the other. 

He complained that we never spend money on our parents (we are very close to them) and this was the one artist she wanted to go see. I told him we always take them out to dinner and pay for them, and we also pay for airbnbs when we go on family vacations. 

I told him he was being unreasonable for being okay with spending that much money in one blow. And he went on complaining that he needed his own savings and money he can spend on anything he wanted. I told him that’s not what a marriage/partnership is. We still can’t be spending money on what we want without the others consent. What if I wanted to spend my savings on drugs?? He said that’s common sense that wouldn’t fly. “Then where do you draw the line?” I thought. 

Ultimately I got so mad that I told him he was being a spoiled brat and I wasn’t booking the Airbnb. And he snapped back to say he IS going to both. He’d just find cheaper tickets. I asked him “how cheap?” If you could find cheap enough tickets for me to be comfortable with, then we can decide whether we can go on our trip”. And then he told me “No. we’re going to both. I’m compromising to find cheaper tickets.” We went at this for a long time and he wouldn’t back down so I finally said, “you’re being a spoiled baby, if you wanna spend our money on both the trip and concert you go ahead. But I’m not going on the trip”. 

I admit I was being spiteful. I bring in steady income since I’m on salary. He has a commission based job, so he brings in money here and there. But we both bring in about the same amount annually. Am I being an asshole for making my husband choose one of the other?

AITA for not telling my RM that our other RM was going to the LO about her boyfriend.,6,156coeh,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156coeh/aita_for_not_telling_my_rm_that_our_other_rm_was/,9,"AITA for not telling my roommate that my other roommate was going to the leasing office about her boyfriend even though we’re moving out in a month?

i, 20f, didn’t tell my roommate, 19f, (we’ll call her Matt) that my other roommate, 23f, (Castle) was going to email the leasing office about her boyfriend, 19, being over too much even though Castle and i are moving out soon. I live with 4 women in a 4 bed 2 bath. The apartment isn’t very big, I have a cat and Matt has two cats—this will be important later. Early July Castle came to me to talk about how much Matt’s boyfriend had been staying at the apartment. This to her had been more of an issue since she shared a bathroom with Matt, and ultimately the BF. I understandably told her that I agree because for 1. he lives a ten minute walk down the street and Matt leaves him here while she’s goes to work 2. he contributes not only to Castle and Matt’s shared bathroom but also the communal space and does nothing to help. For example, he will cook and leave dirty dishes in the sink, stay up late at night and get crunk with Matt leaving a bunch of trash and cigarettes butts out in the living room that the cats end up playing with. 

Castle seemed set about going to the leasing office regardless. Bringing up the fact that we had multiple roommate meetings to find a solution before, even having her agree to come to one and she just never showed. but with the meetings we did have she agreed to only let him over 3 days out of the week, mainly because Castle and I are full time students so we really didn’t want a lot of noise or just extra people over during the first few days of the week. 

the leasing office reached out to Matt letting her know that she was in violation of the lease her boyfriend had been staying over consistently for about 2-3 months. a couple weeks later Matt texted me asking if i was the one who went to the leasing office about her boyfriend. i responded with everything i described before. that i knew it was happening, who actually reached out, and that i understood why. Matt in response said, and i quote, “ you guys are literally moving out in a month. he’s always just in my room i don’t see why it concerns you, i wish you guys would just mind your fucking business, thanks for that”

I responded repeating more in detail all i said before and that it could have been prevented had she did her part. 

it’s been a week since i texted her that response and she hasn’t responded. She did Unfollow me on Instagram and unadd me on Snapchat and leave the roommate group chat that we had. my cat still has fleas but at least I’m moving out in a month so it should be better. my friends and family don’t think I’m an asshole, but am I the asshole for not suggesting that we just talk to her again, instead of going to the leasing office?",1690008660.0

He never did for my sister. Due to my young age at the time, I didn't bother to tell my Mum, who I was far more close with. About 3 years through, I had developed the willpower to tell my Mum. My sister didn't really care for it

&#x200B;

After a couple of years and re-appearances, we had began something. For around 4 years, he'd pick me up from school and we would go to, McDonalds, KFC, etc. He always noticeably spent little on me yet had been spending a lot when I wasn't around. He, one year, stole a house from someone who had asked him to housekeep due to complications with Brexit and had to go to France for around a year.

Around year 8 (which I believe translates to grade 9 in America, since we use Year groups in England.) he had began to be more nasty to me. He would peek into my private life, and try to put walls around me. One day, I had enough. I went to my Mums (which was my primary house) and just cried into her arms. I hadn't seen him again since that day. So, AITA? Or am I just overreactive.

Me and my other half just got engaged. We set a date for roughly a years time got the venue and everything sorted within the month. We have gone for November the 12th 2024 cause we want a fall wedding. 

Now everyone has been really happy for us, excited etc. except my fiancés brother. He is getting marry 3 months prior to us in the summer on August the 12th. He and his fiancé are saying we are selfish and are trying to upstage them quoting “we don’t want everyone to be comparing and forget about our day” might I add we have 200 people going to ours. They have 50. There are 9 people including me and my fiancé who will be at both so I’m not sure who is going to be comparing anything. 

Now we chose not to have it before them out of respect but with aging family members on both sides we didn’t want to push it back another year for fear they may not make it. We also want to start a family as we aren’t getting any younger (probably left it too late tbh i’m 38 f fiancée is 40 no we haven’t been married before) 

My future mother in law also said you don’t get married in the same year as siblings. I have never heard of this. We are paying for the wedding ourselves so it’s not that is family needs to splash out twice. 

So are we the arseholes for getting married 3 months later?",1689934857.0

However, my girlfriend always gets annoyed when I do this. She told me not to sing around her and that it “grates on her nerves” because I have a bad voice. To be honest, I only sing out of habit since I was in choir from elementary to college. 

I want to respect her wishes, so I stopped singing and only hum occasionally, but she doesn’t want me to that either. All of her comments just made me feel kind of self conscious, and I told her that I was going to hum if I wanted to. 

I don’t want to be a petty boyfriend and annoy my girlfriend for no reason. I respect her boundaries, but I’m just feeling like she can’t even acquiesce to this one thing of mine. I never sing around the house, even in another room, because she doesn’t like it, it’s just in the car sometimes. Am I the asshole here?

AITA for getting involved with my sister,3,156es8i,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156es8i/aita_for_getting_involved_with_my_sister/,6,"Hello.
I (20m) have been having issues lately with my (15f) little sister.
Since i have been in college, I do not live at my parent's home but I come every so often (for the weekend every one/two/three weeks). On these occasions I get to spend some time with my family. 
My parents are separated but live under the same roof, different bedrooms (since they get along) until my little sister graduate highscholl for economic reasons. But they are not often at the house at the same time on weekends.
I also spend time with my (18f) middle sister.

The issue is that i've always had a difficult little sister. By every standards. But we've always copped with it as she is our sister/daughter and she has good sides and we love her.
Recently she's gotten into an even tougher phase.
She feels entitled to anything and throws tantrums whenever she is the least contrarieted. (Though she has liberties at 15 that my middle sister and I only got much later)

This is where It gets tricky. My mother has a degenerative diseas. She barely walks (she uses a wheeled device that she pushes to walk), and she has very hard time talking, her voice crakles and sometimes fails.

Two weeks ago, my sister had the opportunity to hang out until very late dancing with a friend of hers at night and when She came back she was tired and slept until the next evening. My mother required that she at least come and have an aperitif with us.

She was Moody, came, and threw a tantrum at my mom, yelling at her. Eventually I juste stood and started to tell her to stfu and not talk this way to my mom even treated as the equivalent of ''cunt'' in french. She told me I had no rights to talk instead of our mother but my mom confirmed that she couldn't even whisper properly and needed me.

Last week i wanted to rebond with her and took her to city to get ice cream. We talked about stuff and eventually she expressed to me that i had no rights to interfere or even express concern about her relations with my mother/father/middle sister.
(My father and her barely talk those days and my sister blocked her by msgs for a whole year as my lil sister kinda harassed her). She is young, doesn't know two things about life and yet feels like she needs no help from anybody.

I understand her pov as this is true that the more i stirr this the more shit is spielled. But my whole familly is tired, frankly speaking WE are even ''afraid'' to talk to her as the least contrariety get turn into an argument.

I'd like to counterbalance by saying that things always were tense in my familly and that she had her fair share of difficult times because of our parents. Yet i feel her behaviour has crossed a Line being way to aggressiv.

So, AITA for meddling with my sister's relations ? Do you have any advices ?

PS: she is still my sister and has very bright sides, i love her, i just need advices on how i either should behave or interract with her.",1690015863.0
AITA for hanging out with friends on my anniversary?,6,156caf6,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156caf6/aita_for_hanging_out_with_friends_on_my/,13,"I (m17) have been dating my boyfriend (17) who we’ll call Jay for almost 2 years now. He likes us to spend every monthly anniversary together and we do manage it most of the time but sometimes life does get in the way and we can’t. This anniversary was one of those times.

I had an appointment with my specialist in the morning (I’m physically disabled), and he had work in the evening. I had plans with a friend we’ll call Amy, who Jay isn’t a massive fan of, later in the week but she texted me that afternoon asking if we could hang out another day instead since something came up. I told her we could do it that day since I didn’t have plans and we ended up having a great time.

I ended up posting some photos from me and Amy’s hangout on my Insta and when Jay saw them the next day he was pissed. He called me and asked why I had been hanging out with other people on “our day” and why it had to be Amy of all people. I told him about her plans changing and how I decided to hang out with her that day since he had work and I was bored. I also pointed out that Amy has done nothing to him and that he was just being jealous which he did not like. 

For context, a few years back, long before me and Jay were together, I had a crush on Amy that she never knew about. He continued to rant about me spending time with her on our anniversary and I told him he was overreacting. He called me an AH and hung up.

This happened awhile back but recently we were talking about our Instas and he made a remake about how his Insta is full of pictures of me, where as mine has no photos of him but multiple photos of Amy. This reignited the argument and he’s still angry. I don’t think I’m in the wrong.
So, am I the AH?

*edit:
I just want to clarify that me and Jay had absolutely zero plans for that day. His shift started an hour and a half after my appointment ended and didn’t finish until almost midnight. There was quite literally no way for us to spend time together.*",1690007390.0
AITA for telling D&D group to stop being gross and clean up after themselves?,59,155w410,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155w410/aita_for_telling_dd_group_to_stop_being_gross_and/,61,"I host a D&D game once a month. We meet at my home because of pet allergies & so their kids aren't a distraction. We’ve been playing for 5 months now, & after they leave, my house is gross. I have OCD tendencies, so my house is always spotless & organized. I clean my house daily. They aren’t dirty people (no one stinks), but they are messy in my home, & I think it’s because they know I clean after they leave. We are all in our 30s.  

One session, someone clogged up my toilet so bad I had to pay a plumber to fix it. Another, I found peeled nail polish & toenail clippings on the floor. Another time, somebody put a plate with food & a cup of milk underneath my couch. I had plans the next day (they knew this), so I was unable to clean my house until two days later. The milk was curdled & starting to stink.   
At every session, at least one person refuses to remove their shoes, despite me requesting them to because the floors are clean. They cycle through who will not take their shoes off. I also find a spill or stain on my couch every time they leave. The couch is leather, so the stains are easy to get up, but it’s still frustrating.  

In the last session, someone had crammed candy wrappers & cherry pits into my couch cushions. It should be noted I don’t know who is doing all of this, but it’s definitely multiple people. When I found the food in my couch, I went off. I sent a group message through discord & said, if you can’t respect my home, don’t come back. I called out all the disgusting behavior, from the toilet, to the trash everywhere except the trash can. I said I am not your mother and you are all adults.   

The DM replied first & said I was being harsh because everybody is having fun, & it’s a party... & cleaning up after the party is part of being the host. The DM also excused the leftover food under & in my couch by saying that the players find it distracting when they get up to toss out trash.   

After this, a few players agreed with DM, & one mentioned that they don’t bother cleaning up because they know I do it anyway. One of the shoe wearers said, that’s why I don’t take off my shoes. You’re going to clean, so why should I remove my shoes? I told them it’s a sign of respect & that if they cleaned up after themselves & removed their shoes, I wouldn’t have to clean as much. One player agreed with me, but she was ignored.   

The DM & most players think ITA for my response & not knowing my “role” as host. I said having a little cleanup is understandable, like doing the dishes & wiping off counters & tables, but having to pull food out of my couch cushions or pick up toenail clippings is not part of standard party clean up & is gross.   

Just because I know this will be a question, there are men, women, & couples in our group of about 10 people. That said, the party is frustrated with me, & for the most part, a good portion of them have claimed ITA. I don’t think I am, but I have to ask with 6+ people saying I am, including the DM.",1689964339.0

We often enjoy making little quips and comments at eachother but something she said while watching the Two Towers this week really bothered me.
Now i realise this might sound a bit silly but for as long as i can remember i’ve been very insecure about my appearance (5’8 110lbs) i also have a condition that makes me very pale skinned. 

Usually I’m fairly quick to make self deprecating jokes as it can lighten the mood around new people and make others feel more comfortable around me, but i’ve not had someone (especially someone so close to me) say something personal that actually realy hurt me in a long time. So anyway here goes;

We had gotten to the scene where Gandalf frees Théoden in Rohan when i made the mistake of asking who she thinks i’d be if i was a LOTR character, (you can probably see where this is going). 
She replied almost instantly
“WORMTONGUE” 
And that “you have that same anxious kinda vibe”…

Needless to say i was hurt and so tried to play it off by suggesting a more apt character such as Gimli or even any of the hobbits due to my stature but she wouldn’t have any of it and kept insisting i was just like Wormtongue..
I really dislike the character for personal reasons and wish she didn’t see me this way. I’ve told her how it made me feel but she’s taking it as a joke and said to “stop being such a baby” and keeps making slithering noises with her tongue when she thinks im not listening and pretending to be Gandalf, telling me i need ousting…
So yeah, as revenge i’m thinking of suggesting that we watch Norbit or something similar next week and tell her she reminds me of rasputia (she is slightly on the large side) Would this be going too far? And AITA for being upset?",1689972018.0

We met through my spouse & have met up for a few play dates (I’m a SAHM of 3) 

I wouldn’t consider us close. But we’ve been friendly for a few years. One day out of the blue she asks for my address and says she has something for me and my mouth dropped when I saw a bridesmaid proposal box. I didn’t have the heart to say no. So being out on the spot I said yes. 

Fast forward 4 years…we’re 2 months away from the wedding & SHES JUST STARTING TO PLAN EVERYTHING. We get texts at all hours of the night with links  to things she’s decided to wants us to purchase asap. Of course I expected to pay for hair, nails, shoes, jewelry, dress. But every day is a new idea and a new required item to purchase.

She finally decided to let us know she wants a bridal shower, so she sends us a date & doesn’t mention anything else about it until 3 days before the shower. I get a text saying she needs everyone to be at the venue at 10am to help set up (event was from 2-8) She also requested that we make a treat table, provide alcohol for the guests, and make food.

So another bridesmaid in the chat basically says its unfair that these last minute demands were being sprung on us & that we should’ve had more notice. Some of the women started agreeing.
So the Bride and one of her close friends comes into the chat attacking everyone for not being “supportive” enough & trying to gang up on her. She called us broke because someone stated that the liquor requested wasn’t in her budget & because some of us couldn’t attend her 2 bachelorette trips & that everyone needed to send $180 towards the airbnbs regardless of who can attend (as a gift to her; due two days from the time she told us)

I messaged her separately letting her know i would be at the shower but couldn’t be there at 10am because I wouldn’t be able to find a last minute babysitter for that long. She pretty much said if I can’t come set up, don’t worry about coming, so I didn’t.

Few days later at 1am she sends out a text requiring us to get robes, no big deal. A few days later she tells everyone who purchased a robe to send it back because she didn’t realize the ones she chose only went up to a large (majority of her bridesmaids are plus sized) & she hadn’t taken their sizes into account. The robes ended up being non refundable so I’m SOL.

Today I got a text saying she’s requiring for us to book a $250 hotel room for the night before the wedding because she wants to be sure we aren’t late. 

I texted her privately to let her know I’m out of the bridal party because of last minute expectations that I felt were unreasonable given we never get more than a few days notice. 
We haven’t spoken since!

So I have to know, AITA or is the bride expecting too much?",1689922686.0
AITA for making someone fail an exam?,38,155yywd,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155yywd/aita_for_making_someone_fail_an_exam/,19,"I just finished my life-guarding course this week, and during one of the assessments, myself and others in my group kind of dumped two others in it? 

Essentially, there's a water-based practical section to the exam, where you have to perform in-water rescues, towing casualties and extracting them from the water etc. 
For the total exam, we were split into groups of 5. There was myself, Hailey, Isaac, Jonathan and George (names changed to protect identities). 

We completed about 45 hours training including 10 hours in-water training. Everyone was supposed to revise at home as well. 

However, on the morning of the assessment, when we were practising, we quickly realised that Jonathan and George had absolutely no idea what they were doing. We were literally teaching them what to do on the day even though we'd spent the week practising. Hailey, Isaac and I had no problems, so we tried to show them what to do and to teach them the correct positions and manoeuvres etc. We managed to get them up to scratch in a lot of stuf, but because we didn't have much time and there was a lot to cover, we couldn't teach them everything. They exited the water not knowing how to do some pretty important stuff. 

Bearing in mind that for this part of the course, you need 100% to pass, so you can't fail anything. When we're working as a group of 2/3 on a casualty, if one person messes up in the exam, the whole team can get failed for that manoeuvre, which means failing the whole course. 

So with that in mind, I was panicking a little bit about doing any group work with them, in case they screwed me over by doing something wrong. 

For the exercises, we would have been split into one team of 2 and one team of 3. I mentioned to Hailey before the exam that I was really concerned about Jonathan and George because I didn't think they'd be able to do everything, and she agreed. I jokingly said, ""We could always split you, me and Isaac into one group and them into the other."" 

As you can probably tell, that's what we ended up doing. It wasn't really planned, but when the assessor asked if we had already been split into groups, Hailey just said that she, Isaac and I usually did it together, and so we ended up doing everything right and passing. 

Because Jonathan and George then ended up paired together and neither of them knew what they were doing, they both failed the course. 

I feel torn because on the one hand, we could have paired one person who knew what they were doing with one of them and tried to give instructions during the practical exam, but on the other hand, they really should have been able to do everything at that point and you don't really want an unqualified lifeguard??

We know each other pretty well, but only ever see each other in scrubs at the hospital. Most of my colleagues are a few years older than I am and some have kids. 


We were all wearing bikinis and having a nice time so far. Then out of the blue one colleague complimented me on my body. It was a genuine nice compliment and I blushed and said thank you. I am pretty fit,  I have a dog I walk daily and I am a dancer and used to dance 7 days a week. Ever since I’ve been working I dance less though. While my body doesn’t look as nice as it used to back then, I still am lean and I suppose pretty muscular, especially the legs. 

After the compliment, another colleague with kids said that of course I have a nice body, I don’t have kids. Some others then chimed in and said how easy it all was before kids and how easy I have it and my body is nothing special. I didn’t say anything because I am pretty uncomfortable with body talk in general. But at some point it became a bit much and I said that I don’t think my body is just from not having had kids but that I also work out a lot. I also said not having had kids doesn’t equal a “good” body and having had kids doesn’t equal a “bad” body. The colleagues then exploded on me and said how I belittle parenthood and downplay pregnancy and I should just wait until I have kids and “those legs are gonna disappear quickly”. 

I said nothing to that and the rest of the outing passed rather awkwardly.

She is like my sister. For context, my parents had taken her in when she was 14  
  
We met in my old school. She was sitting outside the front gates begging for food. I spoke to her and eventually told my parents to take her in. We couldn't adopt her due to the fact that she had parents.  
  
She had AWFUL parents, and neither her parents nor the government cared about her. Basically their child neglect case was dropped. She had matted hair, and was noticeably underweight. We tried to help her to our best.  
  
Around 12 years ago, she found herself a boyfriend, Zach. He was so kind and caring. They really loved eachother. They dated for 8 years and married 4 years ago.  
  
Now, Lisa gives me a lot of stuff. She is 'grateful' to me, she says which is depressing as i see her as my sister and not someone who i helped for credits. Lisa earns around 300k per year and so does zach. and thats a lot of money. She bought me a condo, a car, etc w her money. I always tell her not to but she tells me ""I would've died being left on the streets. I'm sorry im not good at expressing myself with words so i hope my money lets you know that id work hard to make sure you're happy."" (copy and pasted her text.)  
  
She sends me a lot of money monthly as pocket money too. I told her not to, again. I let her know id treat her normally and lovingly whether she gave me money or not, that it is totally unnecessary. However she continues  
  
This has definitely caused a fight with Zach. He said its stupid shes waiting 10s of thousands of dollars on me yearly as im an ""expensive prick"" and if she was to invest this or help the poor etc that it would be better. Heres a text he sent me :  
  
""I'm tired of you being near (Lisa). Look , I love you as a sister in law, you're polite etc but this is really serious. We want a future however it's hard watching (Lisa) suffer over spending money on you. She loves you a lot and I hope you stop being materialistic. Your parents have a ton of money to spend on you. So please stop using my wife.""  
  
It was awkward. I then told my sister its okay for her to stop wasting money on me. She was confused and grabbed my phone and checked the texts bc she suspected zach said something to me. To keep it short, they are divorcing and zach is emotionally reeking over this.  
  
I do believe Im TA, that I dont need her money , im already financially privileged But I also feel like I am not TA because its not my fault. My parents ""tsk-tsk-ed"" me for this and said ""we could've just given you more money. You really had to bother your sister?"" .

She has come home at five in the morning, come home high, come home drunk out of her mind, and sometimes all threes. She does this multiple times a week. This would be fine, but she still lives at home. I personally think that she should just do what our parents tell her since they pay all the bills but it's not my job to parent her. She purposefully does things to make my parents angry.  
For example, my parents are a bit conservative. They don't care how we dress as long as we aren't showing any undergarments. We recently went out and Pearl wore a tight white dress with bright pink underwear, allowing you to see everything. I even told her but she just ignored me. When our parents saw it, we were at the restaurant and they were furious, it was all they spoke about. She just rolled her eyes and said ""I wore a bikini earlier, what's wrong with this!?"" It was a dinner to celebrate me finishing my first year of college, something not common in our family. But then again it's art school, I'm gonna be starving anyways (literally her words) She has also begged our parents for a dog, promising that SHE would take care of it. I knew that a pet would be a huge responsibility and I didn't want to be in charge of another living thing, but guess who is out partying all the time? Pearl. Guess who has to take care of the dog? Yours truly. These are just two things, but you get the picture.  
If she comes home past two in the morning, depending on the state she's in my dad will either lecture her then and there or in the morning. This morning, I woke up to him yelling at her. He doesn't usually yell but this time he was so loud. A lot of the stuff he said was mean, but it was true. Eventually he stopped and he told her that he was getting a refund for the movie tickets he had bought for her and me. (It was for Barbie and we were going to see it on the 20th, a day earlier) He offered to go with me instead since my mom had work, but I know him and knew that he'd hate it so I said it was fine. Pearl started complaining and I just said ""Why don't you stop doing things that you know will piss him off?""(This is the exact convo)  
Pearl: What are you talking about?  
Me: You know mom and dad don't like it when you come home late, what's so hard about coming home?  
P: I'm 23 I can do whatever I want.  
Me: Yeah but your living under their roof, so you should follow their rules, it's what I do and I don't make mom and dad mad at me for fun every five fucking minutes  
P: That doesn't make any sense though.  
Me: What doesn't make sense is you coming home high every night when you know it's gonna piss off the entire house. I don't know when you became so fucking selfish but it has to stop because I'm gonna stop defending you.

about 6 weeks ago now she told me he was going to be staying with us for 2 weeks. I wasn’t opposed but also wasn’t super happy about it but as long as he was only there for the 2 weeks we agreed to idc.

It’s been 5 weeks.

After the third week I reached out to her and asked when he was leaving. She told me that he was going to be staying for another 9 days to get approved for an apartment, the first I had heard of this. I didn’t respond and decided I would wait it out for the next 9 days and then talk to her about boundaries when he left.

This Tuesday was day 11 of the 9 and I text her saying that I had nothing against him or her but that I wanted him to leave within the next 48 hours. I ended the message by saying we should probably set better boundaries for the of the rest of our lease and limit guests to only stay with us for 2 weeks maximum. 

She then responds back upset claiming that because she pays rent here and other bills that she doesn’t understand why there’s an issue. I said that it has nothing to do with them or their relationship I just want my space back. I’m condemned to my room and have to tiptoe around the apartment constantly and as someone who ALSO pays rents and the other bills I’m entitled to being able to take up space. 

She then claims that she is planning on moving out this August which is the first I’m hearing of this. Saying she’s been emailing our landlord, having multiple conversations with him about the process and how he’ll be putting our apartment up for rent come this next month. 

I tell her that legally she cannot break our lease the way she’s attempting to and it’s up to her to figure out the logistics of it all. She backpeddles though, says that she actually won’t be moving out until September but still is leaving.

I call my landlord to figure this all out and you’ll never guess what he tells me. He has not had a single conversation with her about any of this.

He and I talk again the next day and he says that 1. She cannot leave the lease without us all coming to an agreement and new contract and 2. That in our lease it says she legally has to give a 120 day notice before leaving

Woke up today to find a message from my friend saying roommate has been posting that she’s looking for a place to sublease and someone to take over her room here by August 1st, doing things outside of my knowledge and my landlord’s. I call him and inform him that I’m afraid she’s trying to illegally break our lease and that I don’t know where to go from here. I also tell him that her bf has been staying with us for now 5 weeks because it also says on our lease that if someone who is not a co-signer is staying in the apartment there is an extra 200 dollar fee required for rent. 

He says he will gladly make a phone call and inform her of all of this and now I’m sitting in wait to see what happens next. But there is a part of me that worries I’ve gone too far with informing him about the boyfriend and how she might respond next.

I’m happy to do it and while I’m there I always get myself a drink too. 

For the last couple of years if I don’t drink the drink I got myself right away (sometimes I’m saving it for work the next day or just for whenever I feel like it), most of the time he will drink it while I’m sleeping. I’ve asked him nicely maybe 100 times to please stop as I got him what he asked for and got that for myself. Now if I want it I have to go back to the store. Each time he says something like “I was thirsty” or “What’s the big deal you can get another” followed by an apology “I won’t do that again. Only to do it again and again and again. This is a frequent occurrence with my leftovers from restaurants, specific snacks I buy for me for work etc. I grocery shop for the house and always ask him what he wants and know him well enough to get him what he forgets to ask for so I’m not hoarding things just for me with nothing for him. 

This is a small thing, but to me it shows a pattern of selfishness and disrespect. Because I have asked him countless times to please stop and even when I’ve gone so far as to label something asking him not to eat/drink it, he will still do it more often than not. Most recently he asked for 2 drinks which I got him, then I got 1 for me and he proceeded to drink all 3. This has led me to feel like I have a time limit on how quickly I have to eat or drink things before he does. 

He thinks I am being dramatic and trying to start fights when really I just feel disrespected.

My job is more flexible being in medical field I can work my hours to see my patients when I have to but I try not to disrupt my patients schedules/apts some of which are set months in advance. But I’ve changed my work habits since my daughter was born and cut back on my practice and changed jobs to a more family friendly job. My wife has the same job before and after baby and has only taken more and more responsibility at her job I’ll not specify just incase, as it’s a political office. 

We’ve talked about setting boundaries around baby time,  over and over, and it gets better for a week at most. Lately due to multiple staff changes she’s been working easily 80+ hours a week.  We talked and she agreed from 5-7 (pick up from daycare to baby bed time) was baby time and she can go back to work once our daughter is asleep.  Remote for her is easy. Last night she was giving our daughter a bath (a rare occurrence for mom). Her work phone rang and she grabbed it and said she had to take it and walked to another part of the house. 

Now to be clear my daughter was in my view at the time and I acknowledged I was taking over so my daughter was never at risk of drowning in the bath unattended. However my daughter proceeded to scream for her momma to come back (we can say momma/dadda and other single words). Proceeding to full nuclear melt down.

 This is 15 minutes before bed time. My daughter proceeds to go full nuclear for 45 minutes and at one point I heard my wife from another part of the house say “sorry hold on having a hard time hearing you” and then step outside the house. Presumably because she couldn’t hear over our daughter screaming “momma” the whole time. I did what I could and got her to bed. 30 minutes after bed time I was laying on the floor by her crib with my hand on her chest for comfort (she was still fidgeting and intermittently crying for her momma) and I hear my wife renter the house. After another few minutes to make sure the baby was down I went downstairs to confront my wife. We had a knock down fight about barriers againand I was called an AHole for not understanding the stress she’s under. I understand this is just my side but am I the ahole?

Edit to clarify repeat questions.

-planned but faster then expected conception and birth due to low fertility expectations associated with both parities medical diagnosis’s 

-Both agreed we wanted kids and planned to reduce work load once we had our daughter, I have done this my wife has not (this is the primary friction in our relationship)

- she was diagnosed with ppd and had a history of prior depression that was managed with psychiatrist visits and anxiety medication and we both have been active with her psychiatrist plan of care and she was returned to just her prior level of controlled depression following one year of weekly ppd visits. (Now 1 visit per month and low dose anxiety/depression meds) the psychiatrist give us couples “homework” and we do it

-my wife has control of her work load within reason and keeps choosing to take on extra projects beyond her job requirements and bosses expectations, despite repeat agreements that we were both going to focus on our family and not our career during our child’s early development. 

-couple council has been discussed but not followed through as she agreed to cut back from work and again did not. 

-there is no fear of her loosing either of our job as we both work in fields that are short staffed and have much higher needs then supply. 

- finances are not an issue we both like our jobs and could live and retire comfortably on a single one of our incomes.",1689951711.0

Me, Kris, and Cate started Boarding school together 2 years ago, me and Cate have always been the closest in my opinion, but i have enjoyed my time with Kris. And yes as all relationships go we have had arguments, but nothing really big in my opinion. Anyway this year when we started our second year at boarding school, i noticed that Kris was having a harder time, being a bit more, well distant, atleast more than usual. She had always struggled with being social but this was something else, i dont know what lead her to stopping but she eventually just, stopped coming back to the school, one weekend she was just gone. 

At that point i was roomies with Cate, and i asked her where Kris was, where i got the response, ""She stopped? Didn't she tell you?"" To be honest I was shocked, (to this day I still dont know why) i texted her imidately to ask why, but i was left on read. I was a little shaken by the fact she didn't tell me so i talked with one of the teachers about it, which honestly didn't help.

A week later i found one of her sweatshirts in my closet, again i tried to reach out to her, and boom left on read, i even reaches out on tiktok, sms, snap and discord, no answer. 
(Mind you this was back in march/june)

A couple weeks ago i spoke with Cate (who still talks with Kris) if she knew why Kris kept leaving me on read, to which she said. ""She has told me, but i can't quite remember, it was something about, something you did or said i think."" Both me and Cate were a little confused, and i was a bit frustrated, that ahe didn't just tell me so i could apologise. So i ended up writing to her again everywhere, how sorry i was for what ever i had done and how i wanted to make up for it. But still no answer so, WIBTA for keep contacting my ex-bestfriend?

The former we have to maintain by law, the latter is simply open out of kindness, and can be removed at anypoint and without warning.

Today, an irate dog walker started talking to me over my garden fence and enquired if the land and footpaths belonged to me. She was angry about the fact that there were horses on the Public footpath (allowed by law), and that the permissive path was overgrown, so that she did not have the option of avoiding the horses. Her view was that paths were already very restrictive in our area, as many Public paths have large livestock on them, which she avoids, and that our permissive path is one of very few routes that work for her. Had she asked nicely, I may have been inclined to offer to let her know once the permissive path was cleared again, so that she might resume using it. However, she seemed utterly entitled to the use of our land, and was allowing her dogs off lead despite clear signage saying that they must be kept on lead. She was indignant that it was the neighbourly thing to do, as she has used the path for many years, and that I had a ""responsibility when buying a house like that"". Despite being very firm with her that there is no responsibility to maintain that path, I was probably too apologetic and said that the intention is to clear it at somepoint, but that we currently have a newborn and it is hardly a priority. To that she said we should be employing someone to maintain it.

In my view, she is grotesquely entitled. The Public Right of Way is well maintained and free for her to use, in spite of the horses which she does like. The permissive path is nothing but a kindness, and that fact that it happens to be overgrown now is essentially none of her business. With that in mind, I am rather inclined to permanently close the permissive path. It is a long stretch of path, probably around 2km, and is a big task to maintain. Whilst we don't mind people, especially neighbours, walking along it; I have absolutely no feeling of obligation to spend    roughly £3000 a year contracting someone to maintain it, nor do I want to spend my weekends strimming it.

Left 4 dead 2 vs mode is a very toxic community, and my friend is fairly new to the game (under 150 hrs) and it's a 14 yr old game so the ppl who play it alot are pretty good at it and it's kinda a hard game to learn if you're unfamiliar w it. My friend almost always gets heavily insulted by our teamates and they constantly try to vote kick him bc he's not good at the game at all and he makes bad decisions I can't even lie, he kinda sucks tbh but he's really interested in the game and wants to be better.. It kinda ruins the fun for me to some extent bc this used to be the game I'd play to take a break from him for a while. So am I the asshole for not wanting to play l4d w my friend?",1690022277.0
AITA For refusing a gift from my boyfriend because his mom picked it out?,256,155hwlu,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155hwlu/aita_for_refusing_a_gift_from_my_boyfriend/,144,"Hi Reddit

I (21F) have been dating my boyfriend (24M) for about 4 months now. Our relationship has been great and we have been practically inseparable. My birthday was last week and I spent the day after my birthday, with my boyfriend.

We agreed to hang out and get some food. When I got in the car there was a wrapped box in the back seat, clearly a gift. I was super excited because I was not expecting anything. 

When I got in the car my boyfriend says “My mom said I had to get you a gift” and eagerly gives me the box. I immediately got the ick and ask “Did she also pick it out?”. He responded “yea, actually” and my heart immediately sunk to my stomach. I told him I didn’t want it and he immediately became confused and asked why. I explained that I was dating him, not his mom. I told him that his mom making him give me a gift, and picking it out, showed a lack of effort and made me feel like he didn’t care. He snapped back that I didn’t ask for anything and I said I agree and was not expecting anything. He said he would have picked it out but didn’t know what to give me and I told him that I understood and wished he would have either communicated that with me/asked me what I wanted….or drawn inspiration from things I say I like (ballet, rock climbing, makeup, etc). He responded with “You don’t even know what’s in the box”. I told him I knew whatever was in the box would be amazing, because his mother is a woman, who knows what women like. But it wasn’t about the gift for me, it was about the effort. He called me ungrateful and I went back home. 

I don’t know…I wasn’t expecting anything nor did he have to give me a gift. I just feel like if you want to give a gift, you should put effort into it. I also would have been fine not knowing that his mom picked it out. Announcing to your girlfriend that your mom not only forced you to get a gift, but also picked it out is just a turnoff. He seemed pretty upset and now I kinda feel bad….AITA?",1689928302.0

I (17) moved away with my mom now(42) when her and my father got a divorce (I was 10 at the time). She started dating this new guy a year after we moved, and to say the least he’s a TOTAL creep. When I was 11 he insisted on watching me shower to “make sure I’m doing it right” I wasn’t allowed to wear a bathing suit to cover up either. He stopped a few years later when I threatened him with the police. He used to threaten my sister and I, my sister attempted to off herself when I was 14 and ran away from their house to my fathers. He started treating me worse, for example he grounded me for 2 months for reading. When I was 16 I moved into my father’s (43) house as well, but my sister had already move out and in with a boyfriend. My dad was in the military for many years and has bad ptsd so he’s not the most mentally stable and I knew that going into it. It was fine till he broke up with he’s ex and stopped buying food, we lived in the country a half hour drive from any grocery store. He went back and forth with being somewhat stable and then back to being far from stable. He ended up making me move with him into a trailer a 45 minute drive from town. I also hadn’t been able to do much school work because I was forced to do online and he would take my school district computer to use for himself, I have to take a thirteenth/ gap year whatever you want to call it because of this. One night the cops came and took him in because one of his ex’s called them on him. I went to my aunties for two weeks, I am now stay at my grandparents for the summer and I have to decide where I’m going to live for my last year of high school. 

My father is begging me to move back, but he would have to drive me into school everyday. 
My mom also wants me to go back but her boyfriend is still there(she is and was aware of everything that happened.
My auntie offered me the spare bedroom at her house and for me to go to school with my 3 cousins (all around my age) 

Both sides of my family are saying I’m an asshole for not giving them a “second” chance.

AITA for not inviting my friend to eat with us?,76,155r7r0,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155r7r0/aita_for_not_inviting_my_friend_to_eat_with_us/,21,"So, this actually happened a long time ago, but it was brought up again by one of my friends.

During college I had two roommates, both were friends from high school and beyond. Let’s call them Lisa and Tina. It’s our second year living together and Lisa and I get a job on campus at a food place. Tina got a job at a recreation center near school. While working at this food place, Lisa and I become good friends with a couple coworkers. The one that’s relevant to this we’ll call Jerry. 

Lisa, Jerry, and I become good friends and Jerry sometimes comes over to the apartment to watch anime/movies with us. Sometimes Tina would join us when watching. Jerry does not know Tina beyond the fact that she is our roommate.

Jerry was two years older than us, so he graduated first and went on to find a job nearby. When he gets his job, he’s excited and invites Lisa and I to go out and eat with him to celebrate and he offers to pay for our meals. Lisa and I don’t really think too hard about it and go out to eat with him. When we get home, Tina is crying and says that she felt left out because we didn’t invite her to go with us. Lisa and I were a bit surprised because we didn’t think it was our place to invite someone else when Jerry was the one to invite us in the first place, especially since he paid for the whole meal.

Years later I think back to it and wonder if maybe I should have done something different. Are we the assholes?",1689953287.0

Now she sayed thats more than she thought and asked me what shes gonna get for that price, we ended up talking a bit and endet up with some less accessories and a price that i would ask for on an online market.

It is the general belief of the family (including my BIL and SIL) that the children are on the autism spectrum. We have all suspected it for years. My BIL & SIL refuse to get the children officially diagnosed, because they believe it will not benefit the children. They do NOT have them in any form of school either public, private, or home school alternative. They never bothered to enroll the kids because they figured it would be to problematic and challenging for the children. They do not take the kids to the doctor (or dentist) unless they are severely injured. The children have never been vaccinated. The 7yo(M) is constantly exposing and grabbing his private parts. If they as parents were doing anything to address their childrens condition I would be much more empathetic, understanding, and forgiving. However seeing them ignore their kids needs and flat out denie any problem exists over the corse of 10 years, has led me to this stance. 
Current problem: My husband doesn't agree with my feeling to keep our daughter away from her cousins despite their life style. He feels his supervision alone is enough to keep her safe. I disagree. I believe his approach is reactive and mine is proactive. He would rather wait for the problem to arise and then deal with it. Where as I will not put my daughter in a situation I know is not just problematic but is also emotionally damaging. My daughter does not know her cousins are (possibly) autistic so their behavior has no context. When I tried to explain it to her I was told not to label them. FTR we visit them yearly and we just saw them in April so it's not like we're estranged. He wants to take our daughter to stay at his brother's house for a 3 or 4 day trip. I can't go because I'm recovering from surgery and they live out of state. He knows my feelings on his brother's life choices and agrees with many of them. He still insist the kids need to be around each other more. I'm not trying to keep my daughter from her family just trying to keep her from avoidable traumatic experiences.

WIBTA for confronting my mother in law,6,1569vzp,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1569vzp/wibta_for_confronting_my_mother_in_law/,13,"For context: I (25f) and my husband (28m), after dating for 9 years, have recently gotten married and had our first child in June. Literally a month ago. And although I am super excited about being a mother, it definitely comes with its own set of challenges that have made me abit more anxious about visitors which is why We’ve come up with visitor rules. The rules are the standard, straightforward rules you always hear about like washing your hands before touching the baby, don’t put your fingers in his mouth, and don’t kiss him. Those are the only rules I have but for some reason, I’ve noticed people find it really hard to follow. 
For context, although my husband and I have been together since 2013 and I can confidently say I’ve been nothing but respectful to his family, I can’t say I’ve received the same, especially from his mom. For example, not only have I numerously received the cold shoulder but she’s made rude remarks about my appearance, and constantly accused me of “stealing” her son. For our wedding, she wore white and numerous people asked me why she was “moody”. For the most part, I’ve done a pretty good job of not letting it get to me and my husband has been very supportive and really listens to my issues with her but recently I’ve been getting abit too close to the edge because of the way she acts around the/MY baby. For example, when she visited me in hospital after I gave birth, she didn’t greet me and took the baby from my arms. This continued to happen once I got out of hospital. She makes comments about how he only looks like her family (which is obviously untrue). She makes passive aggressive comments about me to the baby like “shame you’re so cold because your mommy doesn’t dress you properly”. But the most annoying thing she’s done so far is not respect the previously mentioned rules of washing your hands and not kissing the baby. Not only does she not follow it but she protests about it, making rude comments. My question is, would I be the asshole if I confront her about this behaviour? Keeping in mind, this woman is not accepting of any criticism of any kind and is rarely respectful of others. We are only really around her when the rest of the family are there so it’s hard to find a time to confront her in private which may make me the asshole. It’s really causing me anxiety about attending family functions as I don’t want to be disrespected in front of my newborn as well as other family members anymore.
EDIT: my husband has spoken numerous times to his mom in the pass but she just guilt trips him and uses the silent treatment to make us cave in. The more he speaks up, the more she becomes manipulative. She would often times involve other family members of his dad to convince him that he was in the wrong foot confronting her.",1689999631.0

It was just me and the landlord's son, Jake. He was a little awkward, but there was no issues. In November my girlfriend (18 MTF) moved in from out of town. She's quiet and kind, no issues at all until around December, New Years. I, 17 at the time, was constantly referred to as my birth gender (female) despite them calling me by my chosen name, and given hard alcohol by my adult male landlord, and woke up in a vomit soaked washroom. Nothing happened, but still. The months progress & we are getting nonstop complaints. I ran a commission business where I had to work with all folk worldwide, so I slept during the day, and spent from 10PM to 6AM online doing work, I don't think I was loud minus a few gaming sessions no later than 2AM. I've turned 18 (April) at this point.

Lou has the room beside my girlfriend's, and I would have to go downstairs when my PC wasn't working to use hers. He'd wake up and bang on the wall as loud as possible, waking everyone else up and shout at us. We'd try to explain how we're being as quiet as possible and if we got a little too loud we did quiet down. 

I tried to explain to him that he works days, we work nights and work from home and he would stop me with ""No that's not work."" I explained I have autism and other issues, I cannot get a ""real"" job without severe accommodation and struggle. Nothing is ever brought to us first, everyone goes straight to Jake, who doesn't relay anything on time, leaving everyone to fester towards us. We've been told to not cook at night and order instead because it's too loud even though I work, then we get yelled at to stop being loud going up and down the old stairs for going up to get the food we had to order because we couldn't cook?

I buy toilet paper, I am the only AFAB person in the house and they use more than I do. I've complained about Lou leaving the entire washroom soaked after he showers. We hear ""You're young, we're adults who have real jobs who need to wake up in time and you need to do this NOW."" OFTEN. I heavily believe they don't see us as people because we're transgender or younger than them. I've gotten to the point where I leave dishes longer, take my toilet paper away, and close the doors a little harder if I know they're awake. 

I use the washroom late, and I'll see Zac's light turn on (He's on the main floor.) and get worried he's going to make a fuss about noise. We have 2 washrooms, yet every time he steps out of his room and sees someone's in the washroom and knows it's probably me (I assume, I haven't seen him do it to anyone else,) he sighs loud and slams his door instead of going to the other washroom. Whenever there's dishes/laundry, even if they aren't ours, he'll stand there and walk away once we start cleaning, even if we try to object. I really can't grasp what I did wrong if I did do something warranting all of this. There's more to all of this, AITA?",1690007456.0

At 709pm, I was informed that the shopper was done. Cool, no biggie. At 753pm, I wrote them ""is everything okay?"" 800pmish I wrote ""hello?"" 805pm they wrote me they had ""internet problem and another huge order""

Now, here is where I'm wondering if I'm an AH. I wrote, ""With all due respect. Should have communicated that when starting order. You checked out an hour ago with raw meat. Raw meat does not stay fresh for an hour un iced/fridge. I would have understood, and you could have done a big order first. Since mine was a tiny order.""

My boyfriend, my cousin, and my two closest friends were all planning on coming. 

Whenever it was brought up, my boyfriend was particularly quiet, but that wasn't odd considering he can be shy whenever we go out. I didn't think anything of it until one day as I was late to work and putting my shoes on to run out the door that he asked if we could talk about something. 

He knew I had to work, and that I was going to be late if I waited any longer, so I figured it had to be important. He said he didn't think it wouldn't be a good idea to go to California, that we're not ""old enough"" to plan a vacation, and that it wouldn't be a good financial decision with too much risk. (It might be worth mentioning he will not be 21 when this trip is planned, but he didn't mention this during the conversation)

I've been saving up for something like this, and I have $2,000 in an account set aside for a trip. The airbnb has a 18+ requirement, which everyone will be well over. I also have no problem loaning him any money he would need as long as he would need it, and I told him all this. 

He said I was invalidating his feelings, but I told him I was going to be late and we could talk over text or after work. 

After that we didn't talk for a day or two. It's what I've called the ""passive-aggressive silent treatment"" but I learned online is called stonewalling. Complete silence other than an occasional ""it's fine"" every few hours in a completely monotone voice. I'll even walk in the room while he's laughing at the TV and he'll realize I can see him and go blank again. 

I thought we were back to normal for a few days, but it came up in conversation again today and he was not happy that I didn't cancel the trip, saying I'm invalidating and I dont care about him/his feelings (pretty much called me an asshole). I told him that if it makes him too uncomfortable, he doesn't have to come with, but I was excited and so were my friends and I'm going. I would love nothing more than his presence, but I'm only going to have one 21st birthday. 

He sat silently for a good 20 minutes while I sat there and asked questions until I finally stood up and just said ""I feel like you don't even listen when I get no response. Why do I even sit here with you like this?"" And went to a different room. 

He left with his phone about 20 minutes ago, very upset. So, Am I The Asshole? Do I cancel my trip because my boyfriend doesn't us want to go? Am I an asshole for telling him he can stay home?",1690020767.0

My mother is still very close with he step dad though, especially after my bio grandfather died.)

But in 2020, I came out as transgender. I was nervous of how it would go over with my family in Indiana, but I still visited. There were many slip ups, bit I expected that. Last summer, I was working so I couldn't visit.
But I'm back this year, and everything was going okay until yesterday afternoon. I was in the living room with Lemon when my grandpa called and asked if we needed anything for the house. He didn't know I was in the room, and Lemon always sets her calls to speaker. So it was then when I heard him refer to me as my deadname and the wrong pronouns. Nobody had done that on the visit so far, not one slip up. And the way he said it with absolute certainty made me think if they were still calling me that when I wasn't around. This deeply upset me, and I broke into several small crying fits throughout the afternoon. I went into my room to call my brother. 
During the call, Lemon walks in to ask what's wrong. I hang up and ask her if they refer to me as my deadname when I'm not listening, and she didn't know what I was talking about. I reminded her about the phone call, and she immediately got upset with me. She started yelling, saying I'm being too thin skinned and that it was a mistake. She went on to yell that I need to grow thicker skin because there will always be people who don't accept me and say awful things on purpose, as if I didn't know this. When she left, I was done. I called and texted my mom until she replyed, and I begged her to get me as soon as she could. She said she would be here tomorrow, and then started to text my grandfather, scolding him. 

I was relieved, but I still didn't feel comfortable staying another night in that house. I called my aunt telling her, and she offered to pick me up. I packed up all of my things, not saying a word to the family. When my aunt pulled up, she talked with the family for a bit as I put my things in the car. Before we left, Lemon comes out holding my hat that I had missed in the packing, and dropped it on the porch yelling ""come and get it"" before going back in the house. 

My aunt tried her best to make the rest of the evening as best as it could be, and as I write this, I'm watching that awful Zelda cartoon from the 80s with a cat sleeping on me.

My girlfriend 'Ellie' (17f) and I (18m) have been together for a year now. Yesterday was actually our anniversary and we went out to a nice dinner to celebrate. Ellie got me this personalized photo/scrap book thing that had a bunch of notes about stuff she loved about me and other really cute handwritten messages. I loved it, especially because I'm moving off to college soon and I won't get to see her every day anymore.

For a while, I was struggling with what to get her and figured that girls seem to like jewelry. I honestly just grabbed the first necklace I could find that seemed like it was a nice quality. It was a silver necklace with a heart charm and rhinestones. I won't say how much I spent on it but it was a pretty decent chunk of change.

When I gave it to Ellie, I immediately noticed that she wasn't excited. She kind of smiled halfheartedly and before I could put it on her, she had already put the box in her bag. It was bothering me that she didn't seem to appreciate my gift as much as I appreciated hers and I asked her about it earlier today. She wouldn't answer at first but after some wheedling, she just said ""It's silver"" and looked at me like I should understand the problem.

After I obviously did not realize what the issue was, Ellie (kind of angrily) explained that she wears gold jewelry. I guess thinking back on it I've never seen her wear silver but I really couldn't understand the issue. I told her that she was being dramatic and kind of ungrateful. Ellie said that she ""expected a thoughtful gift, just this once"" and then left.

I really am at a loss. I don't think I did anything wrong but she's normally not an unreasonable person. AITA?

My (26 M) girlfriend (25 F) who we'll call Casey have been dating for almost five years now, I have a dog Bruno (17 M)  he is a Great Dane and I have to have a lot of money to feed him and give him what he needs. Last year Casey moved in with me and Bruno, Casey's was living with her parents before she moved in with me her father had to be put in a nursing home her mother died a little after she gave birth. Last month Bruno was sick so I took him to the vet they said he had a tumour close to the lungand they couldnt remove it cause of Bruno's age and how big the tumour was and how risky it was they told me to make him as comfortable as possible since he will be gone in the next few months. Casey never liked Bruno she would yell at him for stupid reasons and blame him for every thing she even staged a mess around my house trying to get rid of him. Last week Casey and I had a huge argument about how Bruno was wasting our money and how we should just get rid of him, I screamed at her telling her to pack her stuff and leave she looked at me furious and starting pushing me saying how I'm throwing every thing away for a old useless dog, my dog ran in between us and started growling at her. Casey had a little brother who once got attacked by a great Dane so she was terrified and packed her stuff quickly and left. I felt like a complete asshole cause of her trauma from when she was younger but I've had Bruno since I was nine yr old he was my best friend and still is I can't do that to him when he is almost gone. He was a gift from my mother who had terminal cancer and died shortly after I got Bruno. AITA for kicking out my girlfriend??",1689968895.0

My husband works out of town all week. He usually skips lunch on Fridays to leave early. I called him on his way down to find out if he wanted me to cook dinner or if we were going out. He asked what I wanted. I said Texas Roadhouse. He said he already ate because he skipped lunch so he couldn't eat that much. He also said he was exhausted. He asked if maybe we could go tomorrow. I said that was fine. He suggested I take my teen to a restaurant he doesn't like(Korean BBQ). She doesn't like steak and didn't want to go(and I told him this before we left), so we were going to go to Olive Garden. There was zero parking. Red Robin- zero parking. Texas Roadhouse is right next to them, so I just said let's eat here (it was getting late). My husband is now PISSED and being short with me because I went there. Am I the asshole for eating there tonight? There's also been ZERO mention of it being our anniversary on his part. It's just another day. 😞",1690001569.0

She was in her room getting her stuff ready to go to her bf’s house. But then this guy sam (obviously not the real name) entered her room and tried to kiss her on the lips. She backed off and told him she has a boyfriend. He answered something along the lines of; comon that doesn’t really matter… 
She then quickly got away from him into my room. 

So what’s also important to know, is that sam knows our family and my sister’s bf pretty good and he also knew they’re officially a couple. He even talked about them being a couple last weekend with my sister’s bf and my brother at a birthday party they all attended. 
My sister was pretty shocked and scared cause in a save space like your own room, you just don’t expect anything like this and I really didn’t feel good about having sam at our house for any longer.

So I went downstairs and first talked to my brother and explained him the situation and cause of the sircumstances I was a bit mad and kind of shocked. He answered: calm down don’t always flip out like that! 
So I kinda ignored that and just continued: Imma go send him home now, or at least talk to him cause he clearly overstepped boundaries right there.
And went on my way to talk to him. Sam was about to leave anyways so it didn’t really matter in the end. But I still talked to him and told him that wasn’t okay and he clearly overstepped boundaries. Of course he first told me his side of the story which included “not knowing” of her bf… which he again, definitely knew.

So yeah that was that but I’m kinda in shock by the *reaction* my brother gave. He didn’t give a single f*ck about his guest intervading our sister’s space and almost harassing her and wouldn’t have done anything about it. So was I overreacting about getting mad or does my brother not see the problem? Kinda feel bad cause it kinda killed the vibe for my brother so don’t know if l’m the Asshole.",1689994845.0

● How I should be paying his application and deposit on the apartment (one of our other friends basically forced him to move out here despite me not really wanting a roommate).
●He has medical bills to pay and he shouldn't have to pay any bills here till he pays his off.
● Complaining about how I leave hair everywhere (for those with long hair, you know the struggle. I am also dealing with an illness that is making lose my hair because of my meds. I wasn't doing it on purpose...)
● Makes it seem that it is my problem that he is literally starving me because he eats all the food he bought (literally nothing but sugar i.e. Chocolate, soda,and mayo and cheese sandwiches... and he is diabetic)takes my food, lets it go bad, then blames me for us being broke.
● Never took his meds, his insulin is still untouched in my fridge!
● Refused to budget so he could buy his own food ($300 will last me a month, with him it lasted 2 fucking days!!!)
● Said ""you are fucking me over with this bill shit, you pay it""
●Turned the thermostat down to 65 whenever I wast home

He had apparently been complaining to all his friends and family. He moved out june 30th and all the people ge lied to have removed me and blocked me everywhere.

He owes me for $800 for 2 months split rent, a $337 electric bill, at minimum $220 for all the supplies I had to shell out after his hospital stay, and $100 for taking him back and forth to work. If you want to spy on me for him, I will find out who you are.

We went right at 5 pm which is when it starts to get pretty busy but this location has two lanes and has become extremely efficient plus they only serve chicken and fries so there isn’t much to hold up the line. 
We’re in the innermost lane, and our lane suddenly stops and isn’t moving for a bit which is odd for this place. It was stopped by the person two cars ahead of us who had already ordered, but stopped before they were supposed to “merge” to get in line to pay and pickup the order. 

It took us a couple of minutes to understand what the holdup was. 2 cars ahead of us was just stopped, and the other lane kept trying to let them in but would give up after a minute or two when they didn’t move. This happened with at least 2 or 3 cars by the time we noticed what was happening. It happened again and finally I had enough. Our 1 year old was extremely fussy and hangry and the line behind us was getting really long, at least 5 cars behind us in our lane alone, that I could see around the corner. 

I walked up to the car (my husband was driving) and right when I got to the car they pulled ahead slightly but stopped. I almost turned to head back until I saw they still weren’t moving forward. I went up to the window. I am not confrontational by nature, but I’ve worked enough customer service jobs to be comfortable when necessary. The guy rolled down the window and asked if there was a problem. It was a guy and a girl, late teens to early 20’s. 

I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt in case they were new to this drive thru and we’re confused. I told them they were good to move forward the other lane will let them in. They guy then says “you need to get back on your f***** car and mind your business.” 
Well okay then. I told him it’s my business cause you’re causing a huge line to build and you’re holding everybody up. He said he didint “f****** care and finally drove forward. 

I totally understand if there’s a holdup in the store, but this was not this. There was no reason that I could see for this guy to not move and we waited a for a good amount of time. 10 min ish. It really didn’t look like he planned to move.

But, I have grown very tired of receiving insults, and anger from customers, and the cooks even if I was not wrong multiple times. 

Today, I was very careful with my job, and I was doing it well. But later in the evening, there was a burger, I was unsure on where it belong. So, to avoid confusion, I asked the cook (25ish male) He asked me, what the sticker said, and I responded, “no tomato, no onion, with cheese) and I showed him the ticket which said “no tomato, no onion, no lettuce with cheese). He had a angry tone when he responded with, “well, I would put the “no lettuce” stickers on it if it doesn’t have it.” I responded, “I don’t see another ticket thus the reason I was confused” and he had said something (I didn’t understand) in frustration. He looked angry. I kind of got upset, and said, “I was just asking a question” then he become more mad and said stuff but I walked away and sticks with taking orders and no longer packing them. My manager was doing them afterward.  I helped with the fries, and the drinks instead. After a while, another cook who is also pretty hot headed came in. Ig she was angry that I was no longer packing orders. She would slammed the bagged burgers on the counter. And even threw one harshly on to the counter (it hit the wall before falling back onto the counter.) I picked it up, put fries in and handed it to the drive thru. Then, I loudly expressed that I no longer want to work here because the people are rude and has no manner. There were no longer any words between me and the cooks. But, it was tense. 

My coworker said that no one was the asshole in the situation. However, I feel that I was unfair to the second cook. They were working together thus the reason why I didn’t go back until later. I feel like, I was wrong for that but was reasonable in no longer wanting to packed orders.",1690003926.0

i've really connected with my older sister (34). she has 4 children. her baby was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at 15 months. in connecting with my older sister, my mother takes a lot of offense to this. saying i care more about her than our mother and anytime i spend time with her our mother throws that in my face. i actually spend most days at my moms house by myself while she's at work and then watch tv with her when she gets home. i may see my sister 2-3 times a week and occasionally spend the night it she's not up to driving me home.
 my sister asked me to to watch the baby while she drove to pick up her second oldest from spending the summer with her father. i agreed. this usually isn’t an issue and my mom likes when i watch the babies so she can see them and not have to actually watch them because she doesn’t like kids. i also watched my older brothers son (18months) today and she loved that. 

my sisters baby has been very fussy this past week as she’s not feeling well and her diabetes meds have been adjusted again. generally speaking she’s a good listener but she does have a lot of personality and can be a little wild. but that’s because she’s only 22 months old. well my mom told me to tell my sister to leave me a key to her house because she didn’t want to be around the baby if she’s fussy because it’s her day off. when i spoke to my sister again, my mother was in earshot, so i told her i needed a key in case the baby had a meltdown while we were out running errands near her house so i could sit there with her and my mom could keep running errands. however, knowing our mother i think my sister suspected something was up and texted me to tell me she’d have the woman who raised her watch the baby. i begged her to let me spend time with my niece and i have no issues watching her (i have watched her multiple times when she’s sick and even taken her to the dr. i love spending time with her regardless). my sister declined and said she didn’t want her baby in our mothers house and wished that our mother loved her even when she was difficult and went on to say our older brother was right and she’ll end up with nobody if she keeps treating everyone like shit. i told her i understood and dropped it. 

about half an hour later my mother accused me of placating my sister but i told her i was just texting my girlfriend (not a lie). not long after she got a text and from then on was just ignoring me. i noticed when i asked her what she thought about the show. and i decided to just leave her be. she got up and walked out of the room a couple episodes in and i asked if she was done watching and she ignored me and just went in her room. this is how she treats me when she’s angry at me. otherwise she’d be ranting at me about whatever has upset her.

AITA for saying that I'm a recovering alcoholic?,166,155iv96,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155iv96/aita_for_saying_that_im_a_recovering_alcoholic/,149,"On mobile, so I apologize for the formatting if it's weird.

My fiance (29M) and I (28F) went out to a bar the other night with a few friends. Those friends brought a few other friends as well. We were cool with that and excited to meet them. One of the new friends asked me why I wasn't drinking with everyone else. This guy bought a round of shots for everyone, including me, but I just said ""thank you, but I'm actually a recovering alcoholic. Want to stay sober."" Before he could reply, one of my friends butt in with ""since when?"" She didn't say that with any kind of malice, she genuinely sounded curious and concerned. I think she was kind of hurt that she never knew about any sort of drinking problems I might have had.

I explained the following, but the explanation they got was a bit briefer: back in 2017, I went through a harsh breakup with an abusive partner. The day after the breakup, my granddad who I was very close with passed away, and I lost my job because of a car accident. I was angry, so I started drinking a lot. I decided that life was just easier to deal with if I stayed drunk. While it wasn't about the alcohol, I still drink on occasion, but it's so rare that I wouldn't even say I'm a social drinker. I'll have a rare glass of wine but that's it. The hard drinking went on for 6 months before I realized I needed to stop. 

The guy then called me an AH and said it's sick of me to use a legitimate disease for pitty and said I wouldn't go to a bar if I ACTUALLY were a recovering alcoholic. I believe you don't need to drink to have fun, but I guess he disagrees. He didn't say anything to indicate that he or anyone he knows has a bad history with substance abuse of any kind, so I don't really know where this rage came from. I didn't argue with him because when I get sucked into a conflict like this, I tend to shut down the verbal part of myself so I don't make things worse. After he said what he needed to, I just said I was sorry for upsetting him, went to my fiancé and asked if he was ready to leave. After we left, my fiancé said I didn't do anything wrong.

While I don't think I'm technically a recovering alcoholic, I don't know a better way to put it in a short and brief statement. I had a really bad and unhealthy relationship with alcohol, I'm aware of it, and have bettered that part of myself. I don't let it ruin everyone else's fun though. Having a drink here and there doesn't give me an urge to keep drinking. It's only if I'm drinking with the intent of getting drunk that it becomes an issue, so I simply just *don't do that.* I haven't had any problems with it since, until this.

So, because I guess I'm not actually a recovering alcoholic, AITA for saying I am?

UPDATE: My fiancé and I have been talking to our friends since this happened. It seems like everyone is in agreement that I handled the situation well by not engaging in his need to fight me about this. We've all agreed that you guys in the comments are right about *how* I turned the drink down to begin with. I'm learning that I need to learn that not everything requires an in depth explanation and not everyone deserves one. So, from now on, I'm going to do my best to just say ""no thank you. I don't drink."" And leave it at that. 

Also, the mutual friend who brought him along told him that he needs to apologize for how he acted. He refuses to. So, I specifically asked my friends to please don't leave me alone if he's around, just so we can avoid any fights in the future. I don't know what kind of person he is, but I'm not going to say I never want to be invited anywhere he is ever again or anything like that. Bygones and all that. Thank you all for your responses. I'm learning some new stuff from you guys. ❤️

She really helped me out in a tight spot after my friend and I were struggling to find a place together. She gave me a bed, and a home, and told me it was a safe space. 

I work in a local industry bar that she used to go to all the time to shoot pool. I knew she was 86’d, she told me it was because she was vaping inside. When I told my coworkers (an incredible group of people who I love and trust)  they all looked at me sideways and warned me against it, saying roomie was a mess and an addict and to be very careful. I heard them, but having had nothing but good experiences with her decided to give her a shot because she was always nothing but caring and kind to me. 

Turns out she’s a worse alcoholic than my ex. Once she gets a little sip it just doesn’t stop, she is actively on probation for a DUI and since she’s close to the end she’s going nuts. Last night she got drunker than I’ve ever seen her. Fell off the toilet taking a piss, I run in to make sure she’s okay, and she’s collapsed in a puddle, dead behind the eyes.  I have already set a boundary about not hanging out while she’s drunk, but this is just out of control. She brings random men home, screams at the top of her lungs, gets really aggressive, all around is a mess (as I was warned). I do care about her deeply, she is a truly wonderful person when she hasn’t been drinking but that seems rare.

(Sorry about my English, not my first language)

For context, I (21F) am trying to move out from home with my boyfriend (25M) and another friend of us (25M), our plan is to move until the end of the year and stay there some years to start getting our life’s together. It’s cheaper if we are 3 and we trust our friend enough to make this journey with him.

I am finishing a course (3 more months) to have a better job, my boyfriend already as a job and our friend is doing some interviews to find a new job too.

We already stabilized rules, roles (like I clean, our friend cooks, and stuff) and we already have almost everything planned like the expected price of rent and other monthly expenses. 
We agreed on spending around 300/400€ each on rent and the remaining expenses would be shared by the 3 (food, water, etc…)

My other friend (F19) heard us talking about moving out this week (we are planning this for about 2 months now) and she told us that she wanted to move too and how awesome it would be for us to live together, she started looking at houses online and sending me links, telling me how excited she was.
I told her it was not possible for her to move because:

A) She is still studying and still takes time for her to graduate (maybe 2 years?) and she does not have time to work, and even if it did, it would not be enough for her to pay all her needs.

I didn’t say her this but I thought about it:

B) She is still very immature and she does not have responsibility at all for something like this, she is often reckless and very irresponsible.

C) Does not know how to handle money.

D) The condominium would be more expensive because it would be 3 rooms instead of 2 rooms. 

E) She often gets excited about something new and then gets bored and stops caring about it when she gets it and we need someone that is determined.

F) No one asked her if she wanted to move out, she included herself in the plans without asking for our opinion or approval.

She continued to deny all my arguments saying it would not be that expensive, that she could work on the weekends and she could pay everything and it would be fun! 
I continued to tell her no, no, no but she insisted, eventually we changed the subject after I remanning silence for about 5 minutes but she still thinks she will move out with us.

AITA for asking my husband not to invite his family members to our small house.?,253,155g6vi,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155g6vi/aita_for_asking_my_husband_not_to_invite_his/,194,"So I (24F) got married to my husband (30M) 3 months ago. I am from India, and here people always live with their parents. Now, luckily, just before our wedding, my husband got a job in another city, which is very far away from his home and requires a 10 hour journey with a 4-hour flight.

We have a small house to live in as we are only 2 people. It's only a one bedroom home.

Here's where the problem starts, his family doesn't understand the concept of privacy. As soon as we got married, his mom (my MIL) came along with us. She claimed that she wants to see if we will be able to manage everything by ourselves or not. She remained with us for around 20 days. In those days, we had zero privacy. She stayed in the living room and we in the bedroom, but even if we speak in whispers, it's possible to hear everything in the living room. So zero intimacy, zero personal talks, and hell, my husband won't even hug me in front of her to show her some respect. One thing to add here is that my love language is physical touch. I love cuddling, hugs, and kisses.

Now, after a month, his 2 brothers have visited us. They are here currently, as I am writing this post. They both refuse to acknowledge that their brother is married. They are sleeping in the bedroom, and me and my husband are in the living room.

I don't like to lose my privacy like that. Also, my BIL thinks I am a maid. I am currently not working and am preparing for an exam. I used to study for at least 6 hours a day before, but now I am spending my whole day in the kitchen and cleaning. Because my BIL needs home-cooked food 3 times a day. They refuse to order anything from outside and additionally ask me to make tea and coffee for them at least twice a day. They won't help me with even a single chore in the house. It is to the extent that they leave used utensils where they have eaten and won't even bring them to the kitchen. They are extremely unhygienic, roam around the house without slippers and then proceed to sleep in MY BED without washing their feet. I also had a small fight with my BIL yesterday that I will cover in another post. Still, I am playing happy with them, as they will leave soon. 

My problem is that I don't want any other family members to visit us. But my husband, the perfect family guy, said this is not going to happen. We won't be able to get a big house anytime soon, and he cannot stop his family from visiting. As this is disrespectful.

I (F30) played the lottery for the first time last year when everyone was talking about the Powerball jackpot.  Since then I’ve played casually, only spending a few dollars a week. I occasionally won a few bucks and never really expected to win anything big but it was nice to dream as I had a ton of  debt and have been struggling a lot.

Fast forward to a few months ago (won’t say the month for privacy) I checked the winning numbers one night against my ticket and it matched with my numbers perfectly. Initially I didn’t believe it and thought there had to be a mistake so I told my husband(M35) and we checked it like a dozen times and I was right, we won. It’s Life changing, multi generational, fuck you money.

We fantasized about what to do with our money but the time to claim is drawing near so we have begun having more practical discussions about how to claim it and what to do with it. 

While discussing, my husband “Adam” brought up that he thinks it’ll be a good idea to split the money with his best friend/ business partner “Tim”. Tim and Adam have been friends since they were in middle school and have done everything together ever since. Together they’ve started businesses, work together, invested money, moved to the same town and have often dreamed about our families making it big together. Since we have take risks together and are so close, Adam feels it’s fair to give them 1/3 of the cash prize so that 1) we are not going on this journey to a new life alone 2) it’s suspicious to make all this money suddenly and more easily explained if Tim “makes”money as well since we do everything together. 

I however feel it’s risky to share that we have come into this money with them because Tim’s family tends to be more flashy and like showing off and I don’t fully trust that they will keep it quiet or modest enough to not raise suspicion. This is important because I’ve seen community members harass and attack people with far less money just because they feel entitled. This could jeopardize our safety so I want to avoid it if at all possible. Also I’m not really comfortable with his plan to add Tim and his wife as members of our LLC to claim the prize (because I think it could have them feel entitled to a bigger chunk or take the money?)

Adam thinks I’m being selfish and he wont enjoy our new found wealth if his friend isn’t living the same lifestyle but I think we could find a way to later give them some money after figuring out a way to explain how we came into money without telling them we won lottery (no idea how to do that yet). 

Anyway, AITA for not wanting to tell them we won the lottery and split the money? Am I selfish?

Edit: Thank you all for your input. I think a few things are clear now to me. 1) absolutely a horrible idea to put Tim on the ticket. 2) Claim the money with only me as the beneficiary for now and change based on advice of lawyer. 3) Find a way to help Tim’s family without blowing our cover. 
Thanks again for all your input.",1689857888.0

Yesterday, I (14F) was walking the beach with my sister (19F) and mom (39F), when I was rushed and pushed over by a group of men who stole mine and my sister's shoes out of our hands. Since it was dark, we couldn't see them or where they went, and neither of our shoes  were found. When we get back and I explained what happened to my dad (40M), he yells at me and calls me and idiot for taking my brand new shoes to the beach, and says I should have just gone barefoot. since I had just gotten those shoes and had not brought any other, I am forced to now go barefoot and my family does not care. I would buy more, but my family refuses to buy more even though I bought those with my money. AITA?


EDIT: my mom found some shoes in her bag that fit me, so those are currently what I'm wearing until I can save up for more. I would also like to add that I love my dad, and this behavior was out of the ordinary for him, so that's why I thought I could've been in the wrong. Thank you everyone for your support and opinions!!

EDIT 2: I contacted the store I got it from and was able to get a replacement of my shoes, and only had to pay about $40 for them (I paid $20, and my parents paid $20). Thank you everyone for the support and I will be investing in some cheap ""beach"" shoes also. 🤍🤍",1689959137.0
AITA For telling my step-son he shouldn’t have been surprised when his sister didn’t invite him to her get together?,3336,154wmop,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/154wmop/aita_for_telling_my_stepson_he_shouldnt_have_been/,295,"Hello. I have been married to my wife for 8 years. She has two kids, twins, who i’ll call Jane and John (16) from a previous relationship.

When the kid’s first moved in, it was a bit tense. They weren’t fond of me, and tried to avoid me.

Overtime, Jane warmed up to me, and 2 years ago has started referring me as ‘dad’. John however has not warmed up to me, and i’m fine with that. I would love to have a closer relationship though. Its a bit of a struggle, since if I don’t do/give what he wants, its because i’m punishing him for not calling me dad. If I try to talk, or offer him something, its because i’m trying to replace his father. 
I wish he’d see thats not the case, but I know that’ll take some time.

Jane calling me dad has strained the twins relationship. John does not refer to Jane as his twin sister, either as his half-sister or step-sister. When it comes to birthdays, their mother splits it into days so both of them have a day for themselves, John does not want Jane around on his day.
I know this hurts Jane, they weren’t close as siblings, but they still had a relationship.

Recently, Jane hosted a small get together in our backyard. Some of the people invited also know John, but not as close with him as they are with Jane. John found out, and after it ended argued with Jane about it.

John was not invited because he has never accepted any invites his sister has given him, and when asks him questions, he has started to ignore her. Jane told him a such.
John argued that some invited were his friends, so he should have been invited. But he never accepted the other time his friends were there.

So I told John that he shouldnt have been surprised he wasn’t invited with how he has acted in the past. This made him more upset.

I think I over-stepped the line, but my wife and Jane are on my side. AITA?

Little edit: I did have a talk with my wife. Her and Jane will go talk to John. Just them three. Maybe they can try family therapy again, just them.
John isn’t a bad kid, he was kind with Jane and did put an effort into their relationship before Jane started calling me dad. They pretty much bonded over hating me when they first moved in, so I guess that set him off.",1689872444.0
WIBTA if I don’t let my wife say goodbye?,16,1560rkd,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1560rkd/wibta_if_i_dont_let_my_wife_say_goodbye/,10,"My wife (30F) and I (29M) are getting divorced after 3 years together. I have a daughter (8) from a prior relationship that I co-parent; alternating weeks, holidays, pretty 50/50. When she is with me, I “have to” share my time with my family as they were a BIG part in helping to raise her since I had her when I was young & co-parenting (setting boundaries with my fam but that’s a different story). With that information, my daughter spends 1 or 2 days with my parents, 1 or 2 days with my sister; depending on the week my daughter only sleeps at our home 2-3 days sometimes. I do see her every day she’s with me, she just spends the night or the day with parents/sister while I work. (We are up to 4-5 days now at home since Mid-May) My ex-wife unfortunately would not be able to see her sometimes due to her work having her go out of town or working late or due to my “shared custody” with my family. It wasn’t the case before, she worked normal-ish hours (80-90) up until about Mid-2022, before they saw each other more but afterwards it became less and less. Back to the issue.   
  
I’ve been able to keep my daughter in the “dark” regarding our separation by telling my daughter that my wife left to take care of her younger siblings while her parents went out of the country for a family emergency to try and cover up my wife’s absence. With the alternating weeks and the already established sharing my daughter, she’s been unfazed up until mid-June where she did begin asking when we were going to see my wife again and I dug myself a deeper hole by saying she had to also leave the country because of the family emergency, that it was due to a grandparents’ health failing. We left it at that, and she hasn’t asked for her since. Sometimes if my wife is brought up in the conversation but we avoid it in front of her. During this time, of trying to make things work my wife didn’t make attempts to reach out or talk with my daughter; because she felt that she “can’t fake it” in front of her and we both were okay with the lie to try and “protect her” from the separation on the chance we got back together and my wife was only away for “family emergency” instead of “my parents were fighting and on the verge of divorce”  
  
The issue now is that my wife wants to say goodbye to my daughter, but it’s been almost 3 months separated with no contact, minimal contact when we were together due to “sharing custody.” In the beginning of our separation, I didn’t have an issue with communicating our divorce and I wanted us to tell her together but as time has gone by and I see that my daughter is “getting adjusted” to not seeing my wife, that I’m having a hard time of letting her come say goodbye for a moment and then to disappear again from her life. I also don’t want to rob my daughter of the opportunity to say goodbye if she needs it for herself. I thought about telling her by myself and asking her if she’d like to say bye to her stepmom.

I 28m have a group of friends we always do events with whether it’s raves, festivals, pool and beach days, escape rooms, breweries, etc you guys get the idea. Usually it’s always a good time and we usually all split everything equally so money is never an issue (all have decent jobs). The problem in this is my brother. 

My brother is also part of our friend group and he’s always invited to everything but recently within the last year or so he unexpectedly bails on everything we do and that makes us have to front more for costs. He just decides to choose which events to come too which makes it difficult for some things because they want a body count for the people coming. He’ll change his mind last minute and say he doesn’t want to come or opposite he does want to come and it’s always hassleish for us because we don’t know whether to count him in or he’s my brother and I do love him and we get along great. 

So today he just bailed on another event again.. (not shocked). I told him that we don’t want him around anymore and he’s no longer invited to anything because he’s way to flaky and inconsistent and we never know if he’s gonna come through or not. He called me an asshole and said he’s just busy( he does work two jobs) I just said that we can never count on you and we’re all frustrated at this point.

She apologised for hitting my phone and when I showed her there was a crack she said “oh my god your screen protector is so shit”, lightly apologised and went to her other friends. She soon came back and looked again and said my screen protector was shit for a second time before apologising for cracking it. She knows I’ve saved up a really long time to get this phone and knows the sentimental value I have with my phone. She said she was willing to pay if it was less than $100, but if it was more then she couldn’t. She apologised again of course, but I personally don’t know if it was sincere. 

When I searched up the price to fix it, it was $300, and so I told her. I wasn’t expecting her to pay after her lack of sincerity and since it’s a lot of money, but I just wanted to let her know. Also, she’s boasted to me that she’s made a lot of money over a couple months and has made more than $2000 by working. She told me she couldn’t pay the fee, so I asked her if she was okay with paying me over time (like $10 a week), or paying for half as it technically was my fault as well. She said she couldn’t as “she’s never had the chance to spend more than $300 on her own” and that “it’s shit earning money” and she can’t “justify paying it as it costs as much as a concert ticket”. I haven’t replied to her yet but I think I would be the asshole by just asking her to pay the full fee as it was also my fault for not being cautious at the same time. But the way she tried to explain herself just personally made me feel hurt and as if she didn’t have any remorse.",1690001711.0
AITA for not wanting to go to Europe?,5,15694pv,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15694pv/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_europe/,32,"Hi, so I'm turning 15 next month, however I'm Hispanic, and since I was little I've always wanted a Quinceañera.
I always imagined myself in those beautiful gowns, dancing with my friends and having atleast one night where I truly felt like a princess.

That changed 5 months ago, according to my parents. When the topic of what I was gonna do for my birthday, I quickly suggested that we rent a ballroom for one night, and proceeded with the Quinceañera. I was quickly shut down. My stepdad suggested we go to Italy, since according to him ""that's what all the girls now want, they don't want ballroom Quince's"" (note to reader: I have not seen one girl within my school spend their Quince's at a vacation, every post about their Quince's I've seen, have been parties.), therefore since I barely ever have a say, they proceeded and planned this trip (without considering what I wanted to do) l've only been asked ONCE for a singular restaurant to eat at for my birthday. I'm starting to feel like this trip is for them, not me.

Another big thing is we've had to tighten our wallets because of this trip. School's starting up next month too (the trip is planned for the first week of school, they most important, if you're like me, and transferring to a new school, and want friends.) As of the time I'm writing this, my mom (whose usually in charge of supplies and all that) has not talked to me once, or taken me to get supplies, uniforms, anything upon the matter of school.
They haven't even planned my pictures (Quinceañeras usually get photos taken professionally, to look back on.) I fear by the time they finally decide to plan the pictures, won't even want them anymore since it'll be way overdue.

Last mention, this trip cost us 5k, those 5k could've been EASILY put into a ballroom quince, like the little girl in me always wanted. They worry about the catering not being good, with that much money to drop, we could've gotten good catering. We don't come from money, they had to save for months to be able to afford this. I'm truly disappointed that they didn't hear me out, and proceed with what I've always dreamt of. Every time I call them out on it, I get called ungrateful by them, so AITA?

edit 1: here’s some important notes: 

I'm only ever turning 15 once, and in my culture it's seen as a girl stepping into adulthood, although it seemed in what I wrote above that I just wanted the party for it being a party, I really just want it for the significance, and the deep meaning it holds to spend such an unforgettable night with family, that might not make it to when I'm actually an adult.",1689997275.0
AITA for reading my daughter's messages to her stepmother?,311,155e7b8,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155e7b8/aita_for_reading_my_daughters_messages_to_her/,114,"My daughter is 14. She and I have what I perceive to be a great relationship - she talks to me, laughs with me, tells me who she has a crush on, gets excited when we spend one on one time together, gets angry at me when I tell her ""no"" and every now and then comes and cuddles on the couch when we watch TV. She spends half her time with me, and half her time at her dad's house.

Her father has a wife and together they have three other children. My daughter loves her stepmother, referring to her as her ""other mum"". That's fine. But I started to have my suspicions about how her stepmother talks about me. There were little things, like my daughter saying things to me that she clearly hadn't thought of herself. Offering opinions that clearly weren't her own.

So I looked through her phone. Hear me out. Yes, I know that's not ok. I know it's private and that it was an invasion of privacy. It came from a place of genuine concern. I found that I was right, my daughter's stepmother openly and actively undermines me, says nasty things about me and seems to be trying to get my daughter to hate me.

Things I found:

1. Repeated instances of stepmother encouraging my daughter not to talk to me until I respond to messages stepmother sent me.

2. Screenshots of message I sent to stepmother and she makes fun of my good grammar (""I mean, why does she feel the need to write so formally, it's just a message, it's like she's trying to show off!) I'm a professional brand writer; it's just how I write.

3. Turning things I say into running jokes. For example, I had been encouraging my daughter to find a hobby to get her away from screens, and there were repeated instances of ""haha, maybe that should be your hobby!"".

4. Many, many times where stepmother says things like, ""I mean, I should just ask your mum to come have a coffee with me so we can be friends, but your mum would never come"", which, for the record, she has never done.

She also calls me rude. Now, to be honest, I am not the most friendly person to her, because I have had my suspicions for a long time about what has been going on. I am not overly friendly, I am polite, but never rude. I don't actually care what she says about me. But I do care that my daughter has this constant barrage of negative talk about me because it's never my daughter who instigates it, and she doesn't wholeheartedly engage in any of this. I want to put a stop to it. I want to talk to her father about it, beause maybe he doesn't know what's going on? But I'm afraid of putting more pressure on my daughter (because I don't actually think the behaviour would stop, I just think they would stop putting it in writing), and I'm also afraid that her father will just belittle my concerns. Also, to brign anything up, I would have to tell my daughter I had gone through her phone. No matter what my good intentions were, I understand that that is a complete betrayal of trust.

They've been together for 10 and I've known her for about 5.

There hasn't been a week she didn't have something negative to say about him, from not doing basic chores, him being on the PC until 8 in the morning and then sleeping until 5, ordering in instead of cooking and leaving most of the care for their daughter on her shoulders ever since she was born. Not to mention he openly mocked her post partum depression to me a few years back.

Two months ago this came to a head over him purchasing a gaming chair costing over 600 euros while they needed a new washing machine, leaving her without the ability to run washes for weeks. 
They broke up after a massive row and BFF made a post on Reddit about it, receiving advice, consolation and requests for updates - but most importantly that he would try to get her back once he realised he'd be fucked without her as his live in maid and not to fall for his inevitable groveling.

For as long as I've known her, I supported her. She would message me daily about how much she hated her situation and was disappointed with the ex she was forced to live with. He berated her, made her sleep on the couch and called her names I would rather not repeat as they don't translate well. She expressed her enthusiasm to him finally leaving almost every day; she was eager for him to get the hell out.

When an opportunity presented itself for him to move out she was extatic. It was all she talked about for weeks. According to her she was finally free.

And now? They're back together.

I was brutally honest, too much so I have tl admit. I told her she was making a huge mistake and that l thought she was an absolute idiot for taking him back. While he's nice to her now, he'll fall back in his past behavior again within a month or two. I'm not inexperienced with abusive relationships and it's so painful to see someone I love return to one despite ample warning.

She's now cut me off and hasn't spoken to me in days. I've apologized for how harsh I was after a few days of radio silence, but reiterated I stand behind what I said.

Expressing disapproval over her choice of partner obviously lost me her friendship but I couldn't in good conscience put up a smile and be 'happy' for them.

I’m going to take matters into my own hands and shell out the $30 for a year supply of toilet paper so that I don’t have to play these stupid games anymore.

A couple days ago, a newer girl at our office went to use the bathroom. She noticed that we were out of toilet paper, which is very typical as I noted before.

Instead of asking me what the status of the toilet paper was, she did what I call the “toilet paper shuffle,” where you check the 6 or 7 places you think it might logically be. After checking under the kitchen sink the second time, she was sufficiently stumped and asked me “do you know where the toilet paper is?”

I told her “I think THE toilet paper is gone.” She stared at me for more explanation because I put too much emphasis on the word “the.” I clarified “I do know where MY toilet paper is though” She asked me if she could use my toilet paper. I unlocked my desk and got it for her.

I told her that she could have a roll this time, but if she needs more toilet paper moving forward, she either needs to ask our boss for it, or buy her own. She asked aren’t jobs required to have toilet paper. I said, yeah, I guess you could file a complaint with the Department of Labor too, so that’s option 3. 

But I explained to her that I’m picking my battles, and I’m not fighting anyone over toilet paper and the fucking supply list. I laughed and said I’m not escalating this to a government matter either. I refuse to do it. If I never have to hear about toilet paper again, it will be too soon. I told her I also refuse to bankroll the entire office’s toilet paper habit. It’s bad enough that everyone uses my umbrella stand without asking. I’m not gonna be pushed around anymore.

For some backstore. She goes out of her way to be rude to me for example she has made fun of my weight to the point where I would stop eating. She has also hid food from me so I would have to eat less (and so much more ). She has a wierd relationship with my brother 14(m). She acts like a emotional incest mom to him ( she is also his stepmom ). My dad and I have a good relationship and my stepmom seems to be jealous of that. My dad and stepmom have been fighting a lot here recently ( I also feel like it's important to add that my brother and I live with my mom ). Two of the arguments that I have heard were about me. The first was about when I found a balloon in a junk drawer and I asked my dad if I could have it he told me yes, so the next day my brother asked if he could have it so I told him yes which lead to my stepmom asking where I got it from so I told her where I found it. This lead to her yelling at me for not asking her for permission to have it, so my dad started to yell at her to leave me and that he said I could have it. The second argument was over how much money my dad was giving me for doing yard work ( the money so I could go to my first ever concert). So basically my stepmom asked my dad how much he was going to give me my dad told her he doesn't know yet and so she said that he needs to tell her before he gives me the money so she can decide if I deserve that much or not. This lead to my dad saying that it's his money and he can give me how ever much he wants to. Due to the arguments. My stepmom has been rude or passive aggressive towards me. She has either ignored me or if I ask her for something she will throw it at me. I have been going out of my way to be nice to her and she still treats me horribly. I feel bad because my dad and stepmom have been together for 15 years. So I want to know am I the asshole ?",1689965234.0

AITA for refusing to third wheel,3,156bckg,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156bckg/aita_for_refusing_to_third_wheel/,2,"(Throwaway account)

For some background, I (28F) have always been pretty introverted and kept a small circle of friends. I have historically had one or two friends who I’m really close to, and a handful of less close but meaningful friendships. As I’ve gotten older, people have moved away or gotten partners or drifted away for some reason or another. I know this is a common sentiment.

Cue my current dilemma. My best friend and coworker (29F) of a few years has been in a relationship for about a year and it seems quite serious. I am not friends with her partner, but I like him just fine. They spend almost all their time together. As they’ve gotten closer, my best friend and I have drifted apart. He shares all the hobbies we shared and has effectively replaced me as her “go-to” to do things with. I am really happy for her and genuinely think they’re great for each other, but I’m also really hurt and abandoned. We used to spend almost all of our time with one another. To her credit she still invites me to do things, but most of the time it’s with both of them, and I hate third wheeling. When I ask her to do something, she asks if she can invite him. I try every once in a while to accept invites and am inevitably reminded by how much I don’t enjoy hanging out with them as a couple (or any couple to be honest). I feel left out and unwanted, and couples rarely have the self-awareness to know when they’re being insular. Some people are totally cool with third-wheeling, but no matter how hard I try I end up not enjoying myself. 

We don’t have a ton of other friends to act as a buffer in group situations, and those we do have are mostly couples. I’ve tried to talk to her about how I don’t like hanging out with them as a couple, and tried to make it clear that it wasn’t about them (specified I hate third wheeling in general in almost every case) but I think I just ended up hurting her feelings. I also tried framing it as my just wanting to spend quality time and catch up with her, but that didn’t seem to sit well either. 

Right now I’ve just been slowly ghosting to keep myself from getting hurt more. I don’t see a future where we reconnect the way we were, and this half-friendship and slow deterioration feels awful. Hanging out now just makes me remember how close we used to be. I don’t mean to cut her out entirely, but I can’t keep hanging out with the two of them. I feel like I might be TA in this situation because I know all these feelings are coming from my own issues. My friend has done nothing wrong by getting a partner, and still makes an effort to maintain at least a basic friendship. I feel like I’m punishing her for her happiness by withdrawing, and I wish more than anything that I could just make myself like hanging out with them both.",1690004282.0
AITA for giving only one son a large cash gift?,12,1561r8k,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1561r8k/aita_for_giving_only_one_son_a_large_cash_gift/,23,"Sorry if anything isn’t clear, wordcount!


Over a decade ago my younger son (YS) married his college sweetheart. They got engaged their senior semester and had the ceremony a bit over a year later. They couldn’t pay for it themselves having just graduated. The bride’s family could not contribute- they are low income and had spent their savings on two older daughter’s weddings already. This left us. We agreed to help and were given a budget proposal. It was high but after some research seemed standard for the time. It was not enough. There were almost 300 guests. The final numbers were over twice the original budget but we paid anyways. We gifted the couple a cash gift to start their married life and everyone seemed happy. 


My older son (OS) got engaged to his long time (8 years+) girlfriend in 2021. They initially were going to elope, courthouse wedding with a nice dinner for immediate family afterward. A fancy ceremony was not important to them and they’d rather save the money. We decided to offer the same deal to them, the same amount as the final total YS spent. We did not tell them the number but when approached by the bride’s family discussed it with them. They had been saving for their only child’s wedding for a while and had almost the same amount (slightly more actually) put aside to contribute. They offered to cover the whole thing since we already funded a wedding. We decided to split it. 


This 2nd wedding was the exact opposite to the 1st. Under 50 guests, almost entirely family. Modest venue and minimal spending for decorations. My DIL did most of the planning herself and negotiated for lower prices. It came out to be a fraction of the cost of the 1st even though the budget was technically twice as much. 


My spouse and I discussed the remaining funds with DILs parents and we all decided to gift the remainder to them. They spent frugally and the money was already earmarked for them. A mutual gift from both sets of parents seemed fitting! They initially declined the gift but eventually gave in and were extremely appreciative. They ended up using it to do much needed repairs to their house and put the rest in savings. 


The drama is that YS found out about the gift. He had asked how they could afford one of the bigger repairs and his brother didn’t lie. The cost of the one fix was about what we had gifted YS and they had done multiple repairs. We got an angry call about favoritism and how he needs the money more, especially since they have kids now and OS does not. We explained that we actually gave YS more money- the entire cost of the wedding and a cash gift. OS may have received more cash but that was due to a smaller wedding and funds from DILs parents. 


Apparently now YS is icing out OS and is blaming us for ruining their relationship. It’s stressing everyone out but we don’t know what do do or if we were even in the wrong. Am I (we) the asshole for giving a larger cash gift to one son even though we actually gave less overall to him?",1689977104.0

She wasn't happy with that answer and just kept repeating that I shouldn't be dying and bleaching my hair at home.

I (F 43 ) was. Planning my wedding five years ago in France. Upon searching, I had found an application that does wedding planning that you can use to book vendors. This was very convenient for me as the wedding was in the south of France and I live in Paris.
I booked multiple vendors like band , catering and florist through the site. It was actually very convenient and easy to use. 

Fast forward to my search for a makeup artist , I spoke to several and found one who seemed excellent and the price was reasonable. After a phone interview and various exchanges on the app, we agreed on the appointment. 

Then comes the eve of the wedding, I send her a text to know what time she would show up at venue to begin hair and makeup:

She doesn’t pick up my call and sends a long text saying she was hospitalised and had a fractured tibia and broken wrist. Am devastated . I told her that I hope she gets well soon and start looking for a last minute replacement on the app and literally anywhere else. After dozens of desperate messages, I land on a person who is free and seems experienced. I was relieved and excited.
But, here comes the twist. The lady then says aren’t you the lady who did a last minute cancellation on Cynthia?! I can’t work with you, you’re a horrible person who cancelled on my apprentice when she had booked the day for you! I am like . Excuse me?! I said, ma’am , your apprentice cancelled on me by text.

Some backstory: My mother was married when she got pregnant with me and I was raised by her and her husband (who i consider my real dad) alongside with my older siblings. My ""real"" Dad died when i was five and my mother struggled with depression and alcohol addiction since then. 

My (17f) bio dad (""Dave"") always tried to have a father-daughter relationship with me, which I am very grateful for but I'm just not interested. I visited him every two weekends since I was around 3 years old and started spending nights at his since i was 4. At that time he also got into a relationship, is now married, to a kind woman who has two daughters. 

I had to spend a lot of time at Dave's in the last few years because my mom was in rehab and those times were the lowest points in my life yet. Not only because my mom was facing such serious issues but because i was extremely uncomfortable living with Dave and his family.

I felt like i wss constantly being criticised for everything i did, being online too much, not exercising enough, not going outside etc. This led to me not eating enough because i was afraid i would be criticised for that too.

I also don't feel as important as my younger stepsister. For example I feel like I cause an inconvenience everytime i want to spend time at a friend and need a ride, because I've been told befor that i could ride by bike, while she gets driven to every little thing.

Apart from that Dave is a borderline alcoholic, he drinks beer every night, and is getting extremely drunk at every minor event, which is hard on me because my mother did the same thing. He also gets annoyed or angry easily which honestly scares me sometimes. Not because i think he would hit me or anything but the conflict is very unsettling for me. 

I feel guilty that I don't want to spend more than one night(maximum) there because i know he wants me there but everytime i am there, I am there for him, so that he is happy while i am just miserable. All the things he suggest we do together are things i don't enjoy, which i made clear on several occasions. 

He did so much for me and i am very grateful for all of it but i can't change the way i feel or rather i dont have the energy to.

Hence, she has always done unskilled jobs with obvious low wages. So, I proposed she should go back to school, and she agreed. She put in the efforts, met the academic requirements and got admitted into nursing. I am saying this to lay the context that she is not academically challenged.

But because of her age (40+) and having left school for over a decade, my opinion is that nursing school will be very tough for her. My salary is not in 6 figures, but decent enough to keep us afloat (or so I thought). So, I offered to take on 100% of house bills and expenses and asked her not to work - her only job was to focus her energy on graduating as soon as possible.  The kids are teenagers so they can take care of themselves 90% of the time.

However, I started noticing some attitude towards studies that I know will at best delay (if not wreck) her nursing ambition. I warned her several times, but she chose to listen to her friends. Sure enough, my suspicion came true, and she is super lucky to still be in nursing school and only grappling with extended graduation time.

Meanwhile, for the past 2yrs we are living paycheck to paycheck. It is now obvious that living on 1 income is no longer sustainable and there is no end in sight since she's not graduating anytime soon. To be fair, she has realized her mistake and now she is more serious with her studies (at least that's what I want to believe). But the ship has sailed already, and we need more income to remain afloat. She is very aware of this, so now she is working alongside going to nursing school.

But here's the weird, part, when I asked her to contribute to the house expense (mortgage and utilities, etc), she agreed but paid just once (or 2 times at most). Subsequently, she came up with all sorts of antics and stopped contributing altogether. Note, I didn't specify any amount. I simply asked her to name a figure she can afford based on her job shift/rotation. But I need that figure to be consistent without fail, to which she agreed but ultimately breached the agreement.

WIBTA if I try to compel her to contribute to her own home or I will file for divorce?",1689959383.0
AITA for calling out my friend after she judged me for having kids?,0,156fyha,AmItheAsshole,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/156fyha/aita_for_calling_out_my_friend_after_she_judged/,199,"AITA for calling out my friend and  “humiliating her”

I 36m recently started dating again and told my friends that I was finally putting myself out there and wanted to settle down again.  I asked a few of them to look over my profile and one 28f ( let’s call her sally) told me that I should disclose that I have 2 kids from a previous marriage. I thought this was a wildly inappropriate thing to say to me. I asked her how she believed that was relevant and she tried justifying her position by saying things like “it’s only right to be upfront with any women I date” I told her to worry about her own dating life seeing as she’s not close to being married herself and that if a woman rejects me on the basis of having kids then she was shallow anyway and I dodged a bullet. 


Also would like to add that I of course intend to bring up my kids to any future spouse. But not until we’ve been dating for at least a year because I don’t want to let someone know about my children and see them until they’ve proven themselves to me.


My friends have all told me they agree with me but that I should apologize to sally anyway because she felt humiliated after our fight. I feel this is unfair but am considering it if it’ll make everyone happy",1690019875.0
